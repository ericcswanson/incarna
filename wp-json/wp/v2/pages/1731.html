house guards. It is a boring job, and one that brings him close to the ladies of the court. He disgraces one such married woman with his boastfulness and indiscretion. He is immediately but on \u2018special duty\u2019 and sent to the remote reaches of the fief of Dunstrand to guard over the Duke\u2019s cattle herd.\n<\/p>\n<p>Month 4, 9141 CY; His prowess and what is left of his reputation catapult him to the top of the social pile in the remote house of Baron Redben. His spirits and mirth soon<br \/>\nmake him popular, and his boastfulness makes him the toast and life of the parties.<br \/>\nHe binges however, with little else to do, and his drinking and boastfulness catch up to him once again. After successfully leading the defense of an attack on the herd from Orrish at night, he promptly gets drunk and lets the herd be raided by tribesmen during the day. He is finally let go from the Duke service.\n<\/p>\n<p>Month 11, 9141 CY; He returns to Dunstrand City and begins to burn through all his hard earned money he saved up over the years. He ends up owing a certain money lender an excessive amount of silver and is forced into providing muscle for a local named Pekki Netherwood \u2013 obviously the boss of the money lender. Pekki has an associate named Abani \u2013 a half orc. This half spawn and him find out they have some acquaintances in common \u2013 Porthias and Sandovhal. Finding himself throwing caution to the wind, he and Abani become fast friends. He is shunned by many of the others in the organization that works for Pekki, but Vraxen feels more comfortable with Abani than the other mercs, cut-throats and thieves.\n<\/p>\n<p>9142, Month 6, Day 10; Abani puts Vraxen in touch with a group he said is working for Pekki. They just did a job \u2013 there\u2019s rumors abounding that they did not do well \u2013 and are on their way out of town. Abani introduces them and says Vraxen would be a good addition to the team and help on the task at hand. Headed SW into the Riverdans, Vraxen joins up with the group.\n<\/p>\n<p><b>Vraxen Leaves the Quest for Ancient Blood<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Vraxen, having once again landed in the midst of an adventuring group that seems to be drawing a lot of attention to itself, has decided to sabotage himself and leave for fear of \u201cscrewing up\u201d again and burning his bridges. He has made a small fortune on his latest expedition and believes now is the time to head to a large city and become anonymous for a while \u2013 losing himself in the crowd. His friend Jiles sense there is something wrong, but Vraxen wont talk to him. Having secured their freedom from the latest peril, Vraxen leaves no note, says no good byes and slips away in the middle of the night. His friends discover his absence in the morning and Jiles shares his impressions that he was afraid his horrible luck was going to turn the party against him, as it always seems to. There is much anger, mostly because they mourn the loss of a good warrior and a man who they trusted their lives with and who earned that trust. They drink to his passing and all agree that the door is left open and their is no hard feelings.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Conversion from original Incarna v 2 Vraxen is part of the Ancient Blood campaign.
