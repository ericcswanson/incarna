Today, only hazy legends and myths survive of this time. It is thought by most that the races came from a sinking continent or land named Saemon. No true information has been able to be gathered from the early days of the races of that would settle the east and the center in what was to become Gladnor. Some claim that in fact the races are not natives of the realms at all, but in fact come from some place and\/or time else and were transported by magical means. Whatever the case, races of light and darkness, good and bad, civil and savage all fled their homes. The earliest histories speak of a place absent all gods, but that the Unholy Trio was alive before the Gods of Light walked the realms. Regardless of the truth, no documented history of Helca itself exists by the blood of Saemon before the Great Crossing.\n<\/p>\n<p><i class=\"fa fa-key\"><\/i> <b>The Calling<\/b>: (?) The Blood of Saemon had little in the way of magic or faith, their greatest among them sacrificing themselves to provide power for the means to escape their dying realm.
