Most divinity have a very clear outlook, a clear portfolio of powers, and a set of tenets, motivations and values which lesser order beings will bond with to share in the advancement of them. Such divinities often do not divide their power and dilute their goals and tenets with the more vague and general ones of animism. Animists are not organized into institutions or hierarchy unlike followers&#8230; connection is truly unique and personal to the source of their animist fount. Animist are not necessarily solitary, but they are not compelled to &#8220;preach&#8221; (proselytize) or convert others necessarily &#8211; they exemplify their credo. Animists can and do often try and teach &#8211; but not to serve themselves or even their <a href=../../../../22/index_791818789.html>faith<\/a>, and certainly only through intense personal tutorial to help the student enlighten themselves&#8230; each person must find their own path to the spark. Does this mean related followers or institutions won&#8217;t assist the animist? No. While in most cases, a divinity does not support a organized cadre of animists and followers, animists are considered part of the &#8220;flock&#8221;, in harmony with others of the divinity and worthy of support or succor if it can be provided. <\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Anima_Powers\"><\/span>Anima Powers<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Anima powers most closely resemble those of the <a href=../../../../22/character/class/warlock/22_169624108.html>Warlock<\/a>.
