When a creature makes an attack roll against you, you can use your reaction to interpose the illusory duplicate between the attacker and yourself. The attack automatically misses you, then the illusion dissipates.<br \/>\nOnce you use this feature, you can&#8217;t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.<br \/>\nHypnotic Gaze: Starting at 2nd level when you choose this school, your soft words and enchanting gaze can magically enthrall another creature. As a full action, choose one creature that you can see within 2 metres of you. If the target can see or hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your wizard spell save DC or be charmed by you until the end of your next turn. The charmed creature&#8217;s speed drops to 0, and the creature is incapacitated and visibly dazed.<br \/>\nOn subsequent turns, you can use your full action to maintain this effect, extending its duration until the end of your next turn. However, the effect ends if you move more than 2 metres away from the creature, if the creature can neither see nor hear you, or if the creature takes damage.<br \/>\nOnce the effect ends, or if the creature succeeds on its initial saving throw against this effect, you can&#8217;t use this feature on that creature again until you finish a long rest.<br \/>\nInstinctive Charm: Beginning at 6th level, when a creature you can see within 10 metres of you makes an attack roll against you, you can use your reaction to divert the attack, provided that another creature is within the attack\u2019s range. The attacker must make a Wisdom saving throw against your wizard spell save DC. On a failed save, the attacker must target the creature that is closest to it, not including you or itself. If multiple creatures are closest, the attacker chooses which one to target. On a successful save, you can&#8217;t use this feature on the attacker again until you finish a long rest.<br \/>\nYou must choose to use this feature before knowing whether the attack hits or misses. Creatures that can&#8217;t be charmed are immune to this effect.<br \/>\nLovigdral Aura : (1 Essence) As a reaction you may cause a creatures saving throw or attack roll to become a natural 1 unless they succeed a sanity spell save against your spellcasting DC. This feature may be used a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier per long rest.<br \/>\nLovigdral Shadows: (2 Essence) You are considered to have truesight in any mundane darkness or magical darkness you or an ally create. Upon losing HP you may cast darkness upon yourself and an additional location. The darkness requires no concentration but cannot be moved. This may only be used once per long rest.<br \/>\nLovigdral armor: (3 Essence) Once per short rest you may gain resistance to all damage from the material planes for 5 rounds. During this time you may use a bonus action each round to impose disadvantage upon a targets rolls for their next turn.<\/p>\n<p>Warlock Powers<br \/>\nPact Magic<br \/>\nPatron, Great Old one: Expanded spells<br \/>\nAwakened mind Telepathic communication within 30 feet.<\/p>\n<p>Pact of the Chain: Quasit Familiar: ac 13, 15 hp, 40 movement (fly), damage resistance: cold, fire, lightning, and bludgeoning\/piercing\/slashing from non magical sources.
