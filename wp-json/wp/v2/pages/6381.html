Some rumors say that some of the family escaped with a treasure and were never found, settling nearby under new names. Others relate that they were buried in secret by their retainers later, with their family treasure. Either way, there are always whispers of treasure and magic related to the family in the area of what would become the <a href=../../../../22http/incarnanet/verse/set/steel-realms/places/heartlands/central/dunstrand/bar-innis/crestwold/22_526074413.html title=\"\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"\" class=\"\">Barony of Crestwold<\/a>.\n<\/p>\n[Uncommon Knowledge] The family was a great supporter of Umback\u2019s expansionist policies. The family was wiped out in Dunstrand Vale, and soon after the remainder in Umbak on their  ancestral lands were killed when the manor house burned &#8211; likely a political action by an enemy who sensed their vulnerability. The rest in service had gone on other campaigns to the Impli peninsula and the south. In a stroke of fell luck, all their bloodline was on was killed at once. Those who laid claim to the lands were the last of their kin: a 6th son who could father no offspring due to a riding accident while hunting. Documents show conflicting information: Some say that he passed his lands on to an order of knights, others that he passed it to his mother\u2019s family; one witness heard a deathbed confession that he willed it to his niece (and hints at an incestuous love affair); and still some assert no valid documents exist, and that the lands should go to the crown. All documentation is anecdotal: No single source document ever been found. And so, with the Umbakians\u2019 adherence to the letter of the law, the estate (however small) is in limbo.\n<\/p>\n<div id=\"popmapsrlm\" class=\"hidden\"><a href=../../../../22/wp-content/uploads/srlm-map-handgif/index_1662929950.html><img src=../../../../22/wp-content/uploads/srlm-map-handgif/index_1662929950.html alt=\"Steel Realms Map\" lazyload \/><\/a><\/div><div class=\"modal fade\" id=\"basicModal\" tabindex=\"-1\" role=\"dialog\" aria-labelledby=\"basicModal\" aria-hidden=\"true\">\r\n    <div class=\"modal-dialog\">\r\n        <div class=\"modal-content\">\r\n            <div class=\"modal-header\">\r\n            <button type=\"button\" class=\"close\" data-dismiss=\"modal\" aria-hidden=\"true\">X<\/button>\r\n            <h4 class=\"modal-title\" id=\"myModalLabel\">Modal title<\/h4>\r\n            <\/div>\r\n            <div class=\"modal-body\" id=\"myModalPop\">\r\n            <\/div>\r\n    <\/div>\r\n  <\/div>\r\n<\/div><script>jQuery(\"a[class^='dndclass-cleric'],a[class*=' dndclass-cleric']\").prop(\"href\",\"\/characters\/class\/cleric\");jQuery(\"a[class^='dndclass-fighter'],a[class*=' dndclass-fighter']\").prop(\"href\",\"\/characters\/class\/fighter\");jQuery(\"a[class^='dndclass-ranger'],a[class*=' dndclass-ranger']\").prop(\"href\",\"\/characters\/class\/ranger\");jQuery(\"a[class^='dndclass-barbarian'],a[class*=' dndclass-barbarian']\").prop(\"href\",\"\/characters\/class\/barbarian\");jQuery(\"a[class^='dndclass-druid'],a[class*=' dndclass-druid']\").prop(\"href\",\"\/characters\/class\/druid\");<\/script>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Patron: The King of Umbak; Balthazaar, Lord of Light Crest: Their crest was a striking hawk on a field of bright green and red, a device not used since.
