While they have not coordinated with the forces of the barony, they have remained alert and stalwart in their defense of the region. None of the empires bred creatures have been allowed to slip from the sea onto the land in Sabin Bay, to support the invading troops. A huge part of this has been the secreted Mossbane Pond &#8211; a shallow, large pond that connects many streams to the sea and is a primary scrying point for the druids. It is a hub from which the druids monitor the waters of the western moorswood. Now, the clergy of Elancil has summoned truly frightening beings from the recesses of the deep. Awakened by their call, three Chul have answered. They can move through fresh water and salt, and have been sent to corrupt the pond, and take the druids and\/or their attendants hostage. The druidic powers have dealt with the first, but its appearance has depleted their powers. They have discovered more are to be sent, and require aid to survive the onslaught.\n<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Intro_Missive_from_the_Druids\"><\/span>Intro: Missive from the Druids<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"\">Dawn brings another cold, brisk day. It is overcast, but soon clears up as you prepare for the day. Breakfast is served, and today you just feel like being alone. You gather yourselves into your group and share a private meal together, talking about matters important only to your group. Suddenly, a mouse runs amidst you. Just as you are about to swat it with a mug, it stands up and says in a high squeaky voice, &#8220;Hello! Hello! Hello! No hurt! I run to you! For hidden tallones, in the wetwoods! No hurt! I have squeaks. You come, you help. Tall ones &#8211; smell of loam &#8211; have safe place, needs eyes. Yes, needs eyes and ears. Wetwoods will not be safe, if you do not come. There it is! Squeak! I go!&#8221; The mouse scampers away as you sit around, most of you trying not to laugh. For all of its grave import, that was fairly comical. You resolve to finish breakfast, and talk about what it means. Over the course of the next hour, 2 more similar messages come through. Whoever it was, sent backups. The wetwoods can only refer to the Pranin Moorswood &#8211; and those mice have made one hell of a journey to find you.\n<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Travel_to_the_Moorswood\"><\/span>Travel to the Moorswood<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>3 days to get there without guide, 1.5 days with one. <\/p>\n<div>1-3 on d10: Gwinnish scouting party<\/div>\n<div>1-2 on d10: Baron\u2019s scout (single fighter 2)<\/div>\n<div>1-5 on d10: Foraging party for local steading; 2+d4 hunter, herbalist &#8211; looking for tubers, game because supplies are low and Gwinn has taken most stores.
