The Slaadi may think they are a random encounter and there may be an opportunity to take a captive there.

They look over the realm, and keep the passage from one end to another clear. Each realm has a unique guardian. Those entering the realms via the chamber of circles will, through magic, inform the guardian immediately that they have arrived, and the guardian will not bopther them or their mission.

All guardians can see out of the eyes of many of the statues found in the 6 lands. <\/p>\n<p>Transport to Redouzit<br \/>\nThe party will learn a little of the guardian and creatures of this land; reiterate the Common Knowledge section for the land. <\/p>\n<p>Redouzit &#8211; Uncommon Knowledge:<br \/>\nThe land is truly a thing of beauty and wonder. Standing on one place will eventually see the terrain under your feet shift and become fluid, and the colors and environment is like a million millipedes flaying you one cell at a time. It is a place of endless rebounds of the memories of the past, and the hum of endless potential. Walking in a circle endlessly is said to create a link to the divine, and something of the sort will draw the attention of the great guardian. Many dreams and nightmares can be found therein. It is said the a piece of a Shattered City of the ancient north lies on a plateau of melted and fused glass. Redouzit was the land were seekers of wisdom armed only with hope and nothing else were sent. <\/p>\n<p>The Starting Point<br \/>\nThe great guardian has prepared a star-cross gate that will take the group directly to where the raiders entered into the land. It is unknown directly to him, but the gate has a fate bound connection that transports the PCs to a mostly open and empty field. <\/p>\n<p>Track them across one of the land<br \/>\nThe perils of the Pleading Victim Statues will be difficult to overcome. Their sanity will eb assaulted at every turn and violence among their ranks on each other may be required to maintain their pace and direction.<br \/>\nMake way through traps and sentry\u2019s<br \/>\nStop the sacrifice<br \/>\nFigure out how they got in<br \/>\nRestore the sacrificial victims<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Slaadi have sent a raiding party.
