Their relationship was turbulent, living among the humans for so long it began to fall apart. Neither parent accepted responsibility for their child when the fall out finally happened. Isolated and alone, the humans, Ducateon, other elves refused to have anything to do with him. Bamargens &#8211; a bard of the court &#8211; intervened and took the young elf under his direction as he was nearly starving. So contentious was his parents split, that neither wanted to give him their name. Bamargens got the bardic council to rule that they had forfeited their rights as a parent, he was christened Justav, and brought into the Collegia of the Guild of Solars in Oerdney. He grew into adulthood under the bardic tutelage. Once the basics where taught, he joined the Brotherhood of the Long trail. He was witness to rampant human-centric racism in his apprenticeship, witnessing violence and hostility towards his strange elven countenance. His closest friend, Caergraddon, another elf like himself attempted his bardic trial and was beaten and hung by an angry crowd. Despite this tragedy, he is amiable and well read, the bard is seeking to ensure justice is done. He was sent to the city of Asereht as a starting point for his journies. He traveled along the shores of Lake Caolite, eventually coming to Salt March in the west. <\/p>\n<p>His stop at the Narcosa guild was initially professional &#8211; the guild of Necromancers was an oddity at least and his bardic role required that he seek news from the guild. It has involved him in a plot to prevent a renegade guild brother from reaping a horrible revenge. <\/p>\n<p>The elf harbors a dark violent streak of resentment against violent and hurtful racists, and struggles to not serve as judge, jury, and executioner against those opposed to equality. <\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"A_Problem_with_the_Living\"><\/span>A Problem with the Living<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><a href=../../../../22/host/larry-james/chars/gabrella/22_1309548065.html>Gabrella<\/a>, <a href=../../../../22/host/marc-chapman/chars/emily/22_192049779.html>Emily<\/a>, <a href=../../../../22/edward-berg/chars/dairn/22_223760430.html>Dairn<\/a>, <a href=../../../../22/host/kelly-royal/chars/justav/22_1132362303.html>Justav<\/a>, <a href=../../../../22/host/tara-flannery/chars/toulath-silverhair/22_875904257.html>Toulath<\/a>, and <a href=../../../../22/host/steven-grenier/chars/gaardu/22_102517828.html>Gaardu<\/a> have joined forces to track down and evil renegade of the Narcosa Necromancer Guild and stop hm before he can do something horrible. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Bard 1st Description: Elf (Ynthian\/High), Size [Medium]; Movement &#8211; Normal (30\u2019), male, age: 21, right handed, 5\u201910\u201d, #165, golden-blonde hair (long; ponytail), golden toned skin, brown eyes with violet flecks > character is nearly ambidextrous when it comes to musical instruments and writing; not fighting or anything else though.
