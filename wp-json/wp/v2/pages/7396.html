She has an austere look to her, like she has had to accommodate a lot in her life and is not happy about it. Her shoulder length dark hair is pulled back with a loop. She wears elbow length supple gloves and wears plain clothes of green and brown earth tones. At her hip is a full sized dagger scabbard &#8211; rather nasty looking for someone in her line of work (the Black Shore and river delta are tough places!). Her sharp green eyes are slightly bloodshot, her skin is unadorned and without many wrinkles, and she has no visible scars.\n<\/p>\n<div>Things to Notice:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>She might be wearing a ring under the gloves.<\/li>\n<li>She might be wearing an amulet or holy symbol under her robes (you can see a necklace of silver).<\/li>\n<li>She speaks with a strange accent (south? north?) and sometimes a lisp (Perception DC 10)<br \/>\nShe hints at being from Mosshaven in Bar-Innis (she makes casual reference in conversation &#8211; it seems she had competition there)<\/li>\n<li>Her clothes are ALWAYS clean (no matter how much mud she tracks through)<\/li>\n<li>The sight and talk of money always perks her up (DC 16 to notice a slight salivation)<\/li>\n<li>DC 10 Perception; There are no books in her cottage (if asked, she taps her head and smiles; &#8220;it\u2019s all up here!&#8221;)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Bella%E2%80%99s_History\"><\/span>Bella&#8217;s History<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><b>Recent<\/b>: She came the the town about 3 months before the party got there. Prior to that, she claims to have grown up in the barony of Lily Glen &#8211; she does know all there is to know about the Black Shore Road. She knows quite a bit about the Earldom of Bar-Innis. Her accent is a bit off (DC 15 Perception) &#8211; it does not match any local, it seem more like a mish mash from all over&#8230; more like the accent of one of the Elon travelers. She never seems to have been married &#8211; at least nothing to that affect ever comes up in conversation. Her family is long dead and she wont talk about it.\n<\/p>\n<p><b>Future<\/b>: Bella portrays herself as an older woman, but she cannot help her more expensive taste in fashion. Hints she lets go may indicate her noble upbringing, and she is certainly haughty in moments where she need not be. Her stated end goal is to retire in the out of the way barony of Crestwold. She wants to sell her stores, buy a patch of land, and live the good life. She has several writes of deposit.\n<\/p>\n<p><b>Relations with House Malor<\/b>: House Malor is watching her, but believe nothing more than she is a hedge wizard or warlock, selling minor cures and love potions. They have in fact, used her services. She pays them no mind though, which frustrates them as they believe (though cannot prove) she is using wizardly magic.\n<\/p>\n<p><b>Ancient<\/b>:\n<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Bella%E2%80%99s_Enclosure\"><\/span>Bella&#8217;s Enclosure<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Her cottage has hanging roots, dried plants, petals, and many preserved dried items.
