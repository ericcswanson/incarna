The &#8216;court&#8217; was comprised of the major captured buildings, to which the head as run to, and summmarily thrown against. Multiple participants did their best to never let the trophy touch the ground. The blood smears upon the walls were left until they naturally wore away &#8211; as a reminder. Over the course of centuries, it became a contest of the most heads, and finally evolving into the modern Rauket of today. <\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Rauket_Rules\"><\/span>Rauket Rules<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><b>1st Generation<\/b>: 1st Generation: 5 players per team compete with clubs to place a leather ball into one of 3 goals.

The rauk can be carried or thrown into the goal, but only goals scored by wings count. At the beginning of Each phase a referee throws the rauk to the offensive team. Should anyone score the time stops and the rauk is reset.
