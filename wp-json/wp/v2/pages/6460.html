They treated her well and she has fond memories. The Elon folk she was raised with venerated Ezrilus the moon mistress. In the troupe she was a dancer, fire-eater, and had small acting parts. It was at one her festivals in the Vale Evander that she met Aerd Corwin. Her obvious aptitude to magic attracted him to her, and he offered to take her on as an apprentice. By now, she was long free of debt to the Elon folk and they wished her well and she left to learn magic.  <\/p>\n<p>Apprenticed to Aerd Corwin, who was tried and his tower burned. Dania was one of two apprentices, neither of whom had any clue that their master was part of a Dragon Cult. Insidiously infiltrating into the Vale&#8217;s council, he was eventually discovered through the magic of the Elves of Ynth. The tower burned, and Dania burned. She fled from the tower as it was collapsing, and fire was everywhere. Before she died, she took the master&#8217;s burned out Ioun stones for herself. In the flames of the burning tower, she tapped into magic she did not know she had. A vision came to her of Merkaine, the goddess of fire, and the shrine to her that Dania&#8217;s acting troupe she was with in her early days came upon and cleaned and cleared (this was a happier time).  She embraced the flame and in turn was protected from its worst&#8230; she has been an ardent follower of the goddess and green church\/wyld faith ever since. <\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Tasked_with_Taking_Down_Pops\"><\/span>Tasked with Taking Down Pops<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Gellows Refellow in Mev is the head of the order in Bar-Innis. Star has spent weeks in seclusion with books, teachers, and unending study of scrolls and spells. It is a crash course in the policies and teachings of House Malor. Word was sent from Torrelsons Ford that a Gwinnish knight from a fallen order was trying to restore his memory, in order to provide House Malor with knowledge they could use in the fight against them. The first mission was to be accompanying Pops and Fish of the Blackwells to the Crystal Chamber in Torrelsons Ford. The weather delayed the journey and when Star arrived, two members of House MAlor and one elite bodyguard were dead. Fish&#8217;s body was found the following day and the flooding of the chambers had trapped the remaining member of the house and drowned the guard. Elancil&#8217;s name was all over the work. Star was tasked with tracking down his old companion and bringing him to heal. <\/p>\n<p>Original = <a href=../../../../22/host/casey-cordray/chars/dania-waylong/22_1208563240.html>\/host\/casey-cordray\/chars\/dania-waylong\/<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>WIZARD 4th (Arcane School: Transmuter) &#8211; Part of House Malor of Dunstrand; &#8220;Security Through Information&#8221; Hit Points: 5, 4, 4, 4 +4 -1 burns = 20 Strength 9 { -1 } Intelligence 18 { +4 } Wisdom 11 { } Dexterity 13 { +1 } Constitution 12 { +1 } Charisma 14 { +2 } [&hellip;]<\/p>\n<a role=\"link\" class=\"rtp-readmore\" title=\"Read more on Dania Waylong (&#8220;Star&#8221;) &#8211; Character\" href=../../../../22http/incarnanet/host/kelly-royal/chars/dania-waylong/22_1600136546.html rel=\"nofollow\">Read More \u2192<\/a>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"parent":353,"menu_order":26,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":[],"categories":[],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/6460"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=6460"}],"version-history":[{"count":8,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/6460\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":7484,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/6460\/revisions\/7484"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/353"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=6460"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=6460"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=6460"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
