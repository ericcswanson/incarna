The powers of Twin Rivers blame the civil war in Bar-Innis as the source of the evil \u2013 for the same fell power held a town hostage until a mercenary band drove it north, and lost their lives attacking it in West River Run. for now its evil presence seems to have been driven to ground \u2013 but many fear it will return and begin its reign of terror again. Count Griswold of Dunstrand is calling for actions, criticizing the Duke for his war against the Merchant Cities when he should be defending his people. A Justicar of Balthazaar has been sent from Umbak to take stock of the situation in West River Run.\n<\/p>\n<p><b>Civil War in Dunstrand Escalating<\/b>: The Duke of Dunstrand rests for the winter and has announces that he means to settle the dispute before the summer and campaign season in 9164. The civil war has bankrupted the province of the Duchy, brought with it the presence of foreign powers and allowed Gwinn to cement her hold on the Tarmysian peninsula. The brother and sister cannot come to an accord, though it is the brother, Berithor Aelishan, who is in the right \u2013 the Duke will likely decide against the rebel and squash the insurrection forever.\n<\/p>\n<p><b>Imperial Gwinn Launches a new Campaign<\/b>: In the north, Gwinn has landed some expeditionary forces. They claim it is to pacify northern tribes in a preemptive strike\u2026 but the memory of Hareen Bladehart\u2019s holy war in the north and the massive destruction it caused is still fresh and the civilized lands of the north grow nervous. Imperial Gwinn has landed many mercenary troops in the captured Tarmysian lands of Dunstrand in preparation for a large scale action somewhere\u2026 if not Dunstrand itself (which his majesty the Emperor of Gwinn has assured is not the case) then it must be the north.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Hear-Ye!
