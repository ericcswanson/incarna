That being said even grown-ups didn&#8217;t seem mind having him around at worst cause he seemed well behaved and at best for entertainment value.This leading him to seeing a lot of fucked up shit and learning a lot about human nature at an early age.\n<\/p>\n<p>In such an environment being able to talk ones way out of loss of fingers and\/or teeth is greatly under valued. He earned the nickname of &#8216;Slick&#8217; by having the ability to weasel his way out of the worst of troubles and not have anything too terrible stick to him. Eventually he learned that not everything could (or should) be attempted alone and gathered a small group around him to further his prospects of survival.<br \/>\n<\/P\nHistory: http:\/\/incarna.net\/host\/kelly\/rpgs\/camprec\/c_thug\/\n<br \/>THUG LIFE<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>05\/07\/2009 This is really a third version of Rafe Ryan Character Name: Jackie &#8216;Slick&#8217; Ryan aka.
