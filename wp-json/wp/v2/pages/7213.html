He can spread rumors, hear rumors, and follow the movements of large groups like the PCs. He has agents inside some of the mercenary bands as well (local thug hires) &#8211; and supplies almost all of them with drugs and alcohol. <\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"The_Red_Scarves\"><\/span>The Red Scarves<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Not a guild or brotherhood, just an informal gang. There are few in Torrelsons Ford. These work for LRS directly.<br \/>\n<b>Trevor<\/b>: Trevor is a pale, older man with a long beard. He lived in Torrelson\u2019s Ford his whole life and gives the impression of never having ventured far. He is a Lt. in Lucky\u2019s crew. He runs all of Torrelsons Ford except the docks. All movement of goods and people related to Lucky out of the town by land is overseen by him.<br \/>\n<b>Gang<\/b>: 7 direct; plus freelance informants\/spies and a few thugs that he commonly hires for beat-downs. <\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Lucky_Red_Scarf_(LRS)\"><\/span>Lucky Red Scarf (LRS)<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><b>Appearance<\/b>: Lucky stands tall for a halfling; nearly 5 feet. He always has a wry grin, and is accompanied by his signature red scarf.<\/p>\n<p><b>Where<\/b>: He stays in the boat during the day, and has a booth at The Bitterwheel Tavern. He most often sleeps at Sundri\u2019s Boarding House &#8211; right next to the Sacred Grove of of the Green Church in Torrelsons Ford. <\/p>\n<p><b>Treasure<\/b>: He has the other token half for Anna Waithe (for passage) and her bag of 500sc in pearls if she shows up; he has 300sc in a locked box; he wears about 200sc in jewelry, he has 100sc in wine in his cabin, 120sc in halfling nice clothes, he always carries a potion of gaseous form and one of invisibility. He has a few healing potions stashed on his ship and a bolt hole in town.

Since then the 2 alliances have had brawls and underhanded dealings against each other &#8211; though the barony is mostly unaware of the ongoing dispute. Frad Elgor is still alive, but does not show his face much in Torrelsons Ford. It is rumored that he hides in the Black Shore area &#8211; one thing Lucky has been unable to find is his hiding place. He still has loyal workers, and a source of income from somewhere, as every now and then one of Lucky\u2019s shipments is hit in transit to load or unload. <\/p>\n<h4><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Rumors_About_Lucky\"><\/span>Rumors About Lucky<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Dad killed young in a bar fight (false)<\/li>\n<li>Mom was a prostitute and junkie (false)<\/li>\n<li>Is being hunted by the Umbakians<\/li>\n<li>Is secretly engaged to one of the Barons family (false)<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Frad_Elgor\"><\/span>Frad Elgor<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Frad is definitely still alive and trying to foil Lucky.

Trevor uses a disguise at all times he meets with the PCs. All meetings will be in public places and only with him after sending the PCs a message on where and when to meet.\n<\/p>\n<p>Rules: No killing, no mainming. Be as clandestine as you can. No letting them buy their way out of the confrontation or offer some equivalent solution &#8211; follow orders.\n<\/p>\n<p>Running: PCs spotted may attempt to flee if they fail Stealth, etc. They will be pursued by one or more guards, militia or workers depending on where they are at. If they used a Disguise Kit, they likely won\u2019t be recognized.\n<\/p>\n<p>Choosing: Any; The PCs do not have to agree to any. The rewards can be increased by up to 50% with a major result on a DC 15 Persuade check.\n<\/p>\n<p>Executing: If the PCs are identified in 3 or more, it&#8217;s considered a \u201ccrime spree\u201d and an investigation will occur. The investigation should start at a DC 20, and be reduced by anything in which the PCs are identifiable or tracked back to them (flashy weapons\/gear, colors, not disguising themselves or poor disguises, etc.). If it is successful, the mayor\u2019s aide, Bill Slawe, can be bought off for 500 silver. No amount of trying to leverage his drug addiction will get him to back off any more than down to 400. The PCs have more to lose &#8211; it would mean jail time, floggings, and a major loss in reputation and trust. If LRS gets implicated he leaves town.\n<\/p>\n<p>Collecting Rewards: The PCs wont get the rewards right away. Once Lucky determines that the right outcome was achieved, he will get them to the PCs. Half reward if PCs skip any job after doing a few.\n<\/p>\n<h4><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Orphanage_Gift\"><\/span>Orphanage Gift<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n<p>Mission: Deliver an anonymous gift (in a locked box; illusory script to his contact there) to the orphanage in Red Grass.
