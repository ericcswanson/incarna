The tower, which many believed had been destroyed when the wizards long list of enemies caught up to him, was discovered by a powerful being, who now uses it in a mercenary like fashion.

They are the weapon used to take this from the PC&#8217;s forcefully as they travel through the tower&#8217;s challenges. The GM designates a particular piece of knowledge or memory, a desire or even fear as the <b>MH Target<\/b>. The GM decides what the target is. When a PC dies in the adventure, they do not die permanently &#8211; they have the knowledge\/memory taken from them&#8230; replaced by a memory of hooks tearing their flesh &#8211; a memory to be avoided! When they dwell on it, they can feel the pain [and take 1 HP damage, but recall nothing]. When the PC&#8217;s move through the next passage, their body will reanimate and be teleported to the PC&#8217;s next location (if it is not being carried by their comrades).\n<\/p>\n<p class=\"adv\">You suddenly feel a strange presence in your thoughts. It first whispers, then shouts, drowning out everything. Fear and anxiety replace your calm and focus. It leaves you shuddering and momentarily you are unsure of who or where you are.

Did you die?\n<\/p>\n<p>If all party members have Mind Hooks target taken from them&#8230;\n<\/p>\n<p class=\"adv\">Suddenly the air clears&#8230; like a fog receeding from your brain. You feel like the weights you have accumulated have dropped from your shoulders. You find yourself in a literal fog, as the airs clear everyone is together. The doorway ahead begins to take shape &#8211; a door like all the others in the tower. Then it shines like a beacon. You smell and hear the senses of home. The sun is out, it has just stopped raining. Nothing bars your path as the door opens and you can march clear of this thrice cursed place. The world outside beckons&#8230;\n<\/p>\n<p>You turn around and there is nothing. No tower, no door. Looking around, there is no home. You are where you left of, as far as you know. The reality of everything is like a dream, and you struggle to hold on to the memories.

They must also make an additional slow or fast check to pick up where they left off. Any PC&#8217;s crossing as a group must make a DC 20 Strength check or be bucked loose from their comrades (each &#8220;chained&#8221; PC grants +1 to DEX checks per); shackled or tied closely together characters all suffer the same effects if one fails.\n<\/p>\n<p><b>Careful and Slow (walk)<\/b>: 4 checks @ DC 5 Dexterity or fall and Mind Hooks target is taken.<br \/>\n<br \/>FALL = You stumble and it seems like an eternity.
