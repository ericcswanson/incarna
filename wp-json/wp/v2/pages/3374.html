They have a fort near town with a lab for making potions.  Local leader is Clay Clearbranch a half-elf.  Cost is 10 GP\/month.<br \/>\nEera visits the Rangers Guild as well and departs information regarding the under-dark to several gnome rangers.<\/p>\n<p>They ask us to go to the East continent of Vikmordere to the town of Ribalka to research some sheep slaughters.  The Mayor is Egor Leonid.  The Rangers will pay our boat passage to the continent.  It will take 3 weeks to sail to the continent.<br \/>\nIf we encounter any other Rangers, we should ask them if they would be interested in joining the guild.  Any maps we can procure of Vikmordere would be appreciated.<br \/>\nA half-elven named Faige takes us to the dock.  They give us a bundle of supplies containing cold weather gear: fur cloak, warm boots, hide gloves, flask of sweet liquid (brandy?).<br \/>\nMost are not seasick, but Sinjin is sick for about 5 days.  After 3 weeks we make port in a small village, Ribalka.<br \/>\nWe are directed to the City Hall when we say we are here to see Egor Leonid.  We are guided to a common room.  The Mayor welcomes us and asks us to sit at his table.<br \/>\nSeveral farmers have lost 3-4 heads of livestock.  They will provide rooms at the Dirty Serpent in town.  We can gather info in the common room.  One of the local hunters is missing as well.<br \/>\nA Shepard, Brooks, lost a sheep in the high pastures.  He hires a hunter, named Woln, to hunt down whatever might have killed it.  He has only been in town 6 weeks.  He seemed to be a good hunter.  He set out the next morning and has never returned.<br \/>\nWe head for the high pasture.  Brook has already taken his flock up.  We ask him if he has seen anything unusual.  He suggests we talk with Leth and        , the best hunters.  They have spent time in the Dark Wood.  It is a 3-4 hour hike on a trail.  We escort him back to town for the night.<br \/>\nThe Mayor meets us when we get back and tells us they have had a break in in the library, where Sage Uri resides.  They took alchemy equipment and a book.  We meet sage Uri.  Some healing potions, a stasis potion were taken.  Also a book of early settlers, names and dates.<br \/>\nOn a table, we see a tuft of reddish fur.  Eera asks Uri what this is.  He says he doesn\u2019t know and has never seen it before.  We take a sample with us. It smells canine.  He buys us a pint of beverage.<br \/>\nThe next day we head out for the Dark Wood.  We see tracks of normal forest animals.  The snow is not deep in the woods.<br \/>\nWe are surrounded by wolves, including a dire wolf and a winter wolf.<br \/>\nSinjin casts True strike on Meena.<br \/>\nMeena misses her attacks against the Dire Wolf.<br \/>\nWolf 1 misses Alta.<br \/>\nShe counter attacks and hits, taking him down.<br \/>\nEera moves up to the Dire wolf and attacks, hitting it for max damage.<br \/>\nDire Wolf attacks Eera, hitting her for 11 pts.<br \/>\nThe Winter wolf attacks Alta, but misses.<br \/>\nWolf 4 attacks Meena, but misses.<br \/>\nSinjin casts Sleep, but it has not effect on the wolves.<br \/>\nMeena attacks the Dire Wolf hitting once for 6 pts.<br \/>\nAlta attacks the Winter wolf and hits.<br \/>\nEera attacks the Dire wolf for 4 pts.<br \/>\nDire Wolf misses Eera.<br \/>\nWinter wolf misses Alta.<br \/>\nWolf 4 misses Meena.<br \/>\nSinjin moves up to Eera and cast Cure Wounds.<br \/>\nMeena misses her attacks.<br \/>\nAlta hits the Winter Wolf.<br \/>\nEera cast Poisonous Gas on the Dire wolf.<br \/>\nDire wolf hits Eera for 11 pts again.<br \/>\nWinter wolf misses Alta.<br \/>\nWolf 7 hits Meena for 4 pts.<br \/>\nSinjin heals Eera back some.<br \/>\nAlta crits the Winter Wolf.
