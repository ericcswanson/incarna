We will search for it.<br \/>\nWe run into a half-elf Rogue, named Talia.  She offers her services to our party.<br \/>\nWe decide to check out the cabin in the Dark Woods.  We take the fetish with us.<br \/>\nWe find the cabin and look around.  The door seems to be locked.  While Talia is trying to unlock the door, we hear someone coming.  He shouts \u201chello\u201d and asks what we are doing.  Talia says she is admiring the lock.  Caul is his name and he says he made the lock.<br \/>\nHe offers his cabin to us, as long as someone chops wood.  Modax chops wood.<br \/>\nRax telepathically puts the word \u201cwerewolf\u201d in his mind.  He gets suspicious of us and says we can stay for an hour, then we have to leave.  Rax insists we are just passing through, but Caul says he was in the village yesterday and heard there was a party looking for werewolves.<br \/>\nRax tries to cast Charm Person while playing the harp.  Rax succeeds in Charming him.  She asks him about himself, to see if he is really who he says he is.  He seems familiar with everyone in the village.<br \/>\nRax shows him the fetish.  He doesn\u2019t seem to recognize the doll.  We seem to be out of questions, so we give him some wine to ease his coming out of the spell.    We persuade him that we were just playing a drinking game.<br \/>\nWe head back to town.  The full moon is not for 10 days.  We stay at the Thirsty Serpent.  The sage tells us that silver is lethal to werewolves.<br \/>\nWe hear a commotion outside.  There is a large man swearing, saying he\u2019s going to kill someone.  Rax offers him free beer.  He\u2019s pretty drunk and tells us about a man who asked him for logs and then wouldn\u2019t pay him.  The man had stopped working, and then hit him when he asked him for his money.<br \/>\nWe ask the sage about the ship builder. Soren.  He tells us he hasn\u2019t seen him for a while.  He\u2019s the ship builder in town for 25 years.  He tells us where he lives.<br \/>\nWe head down to the wharfs and find his house.  Balder goes to the door, with Modax next to her.  Balder knocks.  There is a voice that yells \u201cgo away\u201d.  Modax tells him to come out and pay the woodsman or we will come in.  Soren says he won\u2019t open the door.<br \/>\nBalder attempts to break in the door.  At first it holds, but Meena helps him and the door burst open.<br \/>\nWe see 3 wolves and a werewolf.  The werewolf snarls something and the wolves attack us.<br \/>\nA wolf attacks Balder and crits him for 14 pts.<br \/>\nTalia enters the house and attacks but misses.<br \/>\nRax sends an Eldritch Blast at the wolf in back, hitting it.<br \/>\nAnother wolf attacks Meena hitting her for 9 pts.<br \/>\nBalder attacks the wolf that hit him.  He takes him down.<br \/>\nThe wolf in the back moves toward Rax, Meena gets an attack of opportunity, and takes him down.<br \/>\nThe werewolf attacks Balder.  He misses the claws and the bite.<br \/>\nModax casts Magic Missile at the werewolf.  He hit but didn\u2019t do much.<br \/>\nMeena attacks the wolf twice, hitting once.<br \/>\nTalia sneaks behind the werewolf and hits him.  But the rapier doesn\u2019t seem to damage him.<br \/>\nRax casts Witch Bolt on the werewolf, hitting him.<br \/>\nThe wolf attacks Meena but misses.<br \/>\nBalder attacks the werewolf, hitting him.<br \/>\nThe werewolf attacks Balder, hitting with one claw for 7, he crits on the bite.  Balder is down.<br \/>\nModax casts Magic Missiles at the werewolf.<br \/>\nMeena attacks the werewolf, critting him on the first attack.  She hits on the second attack, hitting him, but doing no damage.<br \/>\nTalia attacks the wolf, hitting it.<br \/>\nRax moves next to Balder and heals her back to 1 pt.<br \/>\nThe wolf turns and bites Talia.<br \/>\nBalder uses his second wind to regain strength.<br \/>\nThe werewolf attacks Meena putting her down.<br \/>\nModax casts Chill Touch against the werewolf, but misses.<br \/>\nMeena makes one death save.<br \/>\nRax casts Witch Bolt on the werewolf, taking him down.  She then moves to Meena\u2019s body to protect it.<br \/>\nThe wolf misses Talia.<br \/>\nBalder attacks the wolf, but misses.<br \/>\nModax stabilizes Meena.<br \/>\nMeena takes out the wolf.<br \/>\nWe level up to 3.<br \/>\nWe have taken out all the werewolves.  The town wines and dines us.   The mayor gives the party another 200 GP.  The shipbuilder\u2019s son gives us 100 GP as well for saving his family name.<br \/>\nWe divide up the party gold with 393 each.<br \/>\nMeena adds 7 to her HP.  Will take the Hunter Archetype and the Colossus Slayer feature.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>World of Ph&#8217;yrin Tys!
