His mother was an orc, and his father was a human. The circumstances of how it happened, his mother never told him. Those in the tribe hinted he was a slave, and died.<\/p>\n<p>He was raised by his mother, and she sought out the shaman to teach him the language of humans so that he may have a better chance of survival as a half breed. He grew up partly nomadic as a hunter-gatherer. He was taught to respect the land, the wind, the sun and the rain. As his tribe was not very accepting of him, he spent many hours alone in the woods and hills. He volunteered to be a wood cutter, it was one of the most solitary jobs he could get within the tribe &#8211; to keep him away from the brutal warriors. He got good with climbing and axes (large and small) this way, learning to fell trees very swiftly. While felling wood for travois for the tribe, he was set upon by the tribes hunters. They had cornered a coyote and slain it, and were amped up. They beat him severely and he fled to the edge of the forest. He came upon the coyote den with pups. These were the first animals he learned to care for. Thereafter he made a point of finding animal orphans and raising them. Mostly he would trade within the tribe and sometimes with humans. Animal husbandry became a passion.<\/p>\n<p>Among his tribe, he kept to himself, he is usually quiet and observant, his folk think him dim. He learned that half-breeds are not listened to, and only good for menial tasks. Equality was not part of his peoples way &#8211; gender, race, and power dictated procedure, not rights or laws. <\/p>\n<p>The tribe grew, and traded with the human lands. His people migrated and hunted. They slowly became more sedentary. Eventually they and the humans mingled and he spent more time with the humans &#8211; he was small and weak in his tribe, but among the humans he felt large and strong. Hunting was something he could do for him and his mother alone, and he grew his skills around this. <\/p>\n<p>He was in the crowd at an execution when the aging executioner tripped. He assisted and afterward became an apprentice with two others. He said he was 19, but in reality he was only 14. The town of Dorath grew to a city of 10,000 with rolling farmlands over the next few years. He learned patience in hunting, and the slow progress of the law. <\/p>\n<p>After years, and much experience with the headsman, bounty hunters, jailers, and judges, he was able to officially enter the ranks of jailers and headsmen. He took his oath to never be judge or jury, only executioner. He accepted the marks (tattoos) on his forehead and the backs of his hands, of the closed eye. His teacher made him swear an oath to execute the lawfully appointed authorities command to watch over and punish those detained by the law. The law is what protected him and his position in a society that was not overly welcoming &#8211; so he adopted its letter wholeheartedly.<\/p>\n<p>He was swept up in a war between nomadic humans who moved into the region and his adopted city. The reservoir of fury held in check by the ways of law and civilization was unleashed. He did well, but many of his fellow volunteers were scared of him. He served as the army jailer executioner as well. The nomads were conquered, and they were driven off or settled in villages and became part of the growing city state. There was a tumultuous time &#8211; there were many executions while they assimilated.<\/p>\n<p>Served in the city watch, then the military, mostly as a scout outside the city. Learned to use the crossbow against the marauders of Merowey. <\/p>\n<p>At 25, he decided to let his friend that he trained with, Luke, take the official role of executioner for the city state of Dorath. His mother had died and his people had been settled or resumed their hunter-gatherer ways and left the area. The people had grown afraid of him, with rumors of his savage ferocity making people distrust him. He knew he had to go somewhere else and start over. He left to make his fortune.<\/p>\n<p><b>The Journey to Hiddzwaur<\/b><br \/>\nCast out and alone, Caramin goes east, to the coast. He works his way north along the coast, learning to swim and to haul large nets. His temper would get the best of him in many places, and he would eventually leave. It took him a year to make his way to Hiddzwaur (the Kaithlen were pushed out) &#8211; following the tales and news from the greatest town of the area. It took all his abilities to avoid the Kaithlen and the burgeoning war that tore the area apart. Hiddzwaur was the island of stability for 50 miles, and a destination for many. Rumors had it for years that it was growing and attracting many, Caramin decided that he may find a need for his talents there. Hiddzwaur was no longer active though, but had many farmsteads and a thriving maritime community that was rebuilding around the ruins. It reminded him of the early days of Dorath. This made it a target, and Caramin knew that he had matured and honed his skills in the hundreds of miles to get to the town. Spent 2 years, near permanent member of the militia.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"hid\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Hiddzwar\/Salt_Marsh_Campaign\"><\/span>Hiddzwar\/Salt Marsh Campaign<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Kaithlen moved on to prevent war in the area &#8211; only the savage ones stay<br \/>\nTemple to Medja was used to rebuild other buildings<br \/>\nMilitia = 10 at any given time + captain and second (hammer) in charge<\/p>\n<p>Big fish festival, we (Caramin + Mufasa) are conscripted to serve as security<br \/>\nThere is a run that is around the wall and then over pilings from one dock to another<br \/>\nWe get happy drunk to prevent him from trying to ambush the beer wagon (we are assigned to protect)<br \/>\n1 hour to messenger post<br \/>\nFISH LEGS = hired us to tip crates into harbor; former pirate and smuggler and operative for Vern Kelps)<br \/>\nVERN KELPS = Local fishmonger (mogul of the area\/wealthiest in town)<br \/>\nHAPPY FIELDS = Former paladin of Methrane; drunkard<br \/>\nBENTER SMITH = Head Jailer<br \/>\nMARCUS FISHER = Harbormaster<br \/>\nTED BAILEY = &#8220;Baileys Bar&#8221; (heaith)\/Inn Owner (expensive; plus penny hangs)<br \/>\n&gt; our &#8220;sign&#8221; for trouble is his staff brings me a drink<br \/>\nFATHER CORPUS WHALER = Penitent\/devout of church of the elements (Lasio\/water); cartographer<\/p>\n<p>Half hour till wagon, teamster + 2 guards = success<br \/>\nWe knock crates in to be raided<br \/>\nFestival fight with Mufasa<br \/>\nMill area attacked, realize its a diversion<br \/>\nKelly hides on docks and waits for the swimmers coming in that he spotted<br \/>\n30 climb out, 3 teams; 15, 10, 5<br \/>\nTeam 10 goes toward mine, rest pillages with flame<br \/>\nTeam 5 on docks, Caramin and militia handle<br \/>\nWe swim out to boat (dog paddle Caramin, Mufasa catches up) and take out guards<br \/>\nWe try to ambush returning raiders<br \/>\nWe beach the boat after waiting<br \/>\nWe get militia and kill the sea creature in the cabin; Caramin gets taken out as a shield for the rest<br \/>\nAggressive behavior lands Mufasa in prison (3 days)<br \/>\nWe leave for a rest trip and go to the mines &#8211; mines opened after Kaithlen<br \/>\nMines are guarded, we bribe the guards and stay for a night<br \/>\nWe find where the raiders were killed by specters<br \/>\nThe second in charge of the guard and ex-paladin tracks show up as finding the same thing<br \/>\nSpecters attack and we run &#8211; ten of them.<br \/>\nWe take an additional day to return &#8211; to make it look like we did leave to relax<br \/>\nSo, is there someone we can talk to about the specters we encountered?<br \/>\n&gt; Thus far nobody knows anything. All of the Guardsmen you&#8217;ve spoken to were given orders by either the Mayor or the &#8216;Hammer&#8217; to keep people out. No explanation given.<br \/>\nThe locals who were at the mine during the attack only know that the raiders came in, killed whoever was in their path and ran into the mines. They never saw anyone come out, but before the attacks on the town had stopped they were told to evacuate and then the following day informed that the area was closed down and that they were not to go back. The town treasury even covered their wages for the month. Cursory talks do not reveal who initially gave the order to evacuate. It seems most people were told by other Miners and laborers that they needed to get out.<\/p>\n<p>Is there any presence of faith in the town?<br \/>\n&gt; For information on the Divine, mystical, odd or historical your best sources are any unique people making port (long shot), the Mayor (Wyeth Green), Father Corpus Whaler (A penitent of the elemental faith, Devoted to Lauccio) and MAYBE the Militia captain Kenneth Green.<br \/>\n&gt; The Ex Paladin, Happy Field (No one argues with him about that being his name any more), was a follower of Methran.

Not good enough for Caramin. That relies on her being alive.<\/p>\n<p>Drops off at delta of silty river via rowboat. They will wait in bog and whistle a certain way to summon them to row us out. Night more ideal; ask for Timmy Jim, say the &#8220;hot one sent us&#8221; and get package.<br \/>\nLeechwaters here we come. We came from Saltmarsh &#8211; looking for work as mercenaries.<br \/>\n+2 hours and scout: argue on road, lots of leeches, venomous eels (delicacy) in muck, Mufasa gets bit = fuck this place. pop 250, ground rises as dry, lots of built stone structures more than straw and mud; head to tavern. Locals want us out, we want work, referred to TJ, he says we are weird couriers, but OK. Asks us toconfirm who sent us, Caramin gives him 5 seconds. Bob ferries us out to dry through bog. Bobs tells Caramin how to prepare as exotic food.<\/p>\n<p>1 week time limit on Tidesbreak Island (singular, not part of a chain)<br \/>\nLongboat takes us in to 20&#8242; (chaos ward) &#8211; we dont really get a feeling, but Caramin feels like holy ground<br \/>\nUndergrowth\/Overgrowth = none\/light scrub<br \/>\nTrees = no\/small\/scrub<br \/>\nAnimal Population = birds, crabs, fish<br \/>\nElevation and grade = (highest point? 75&#8242; spire) up to center point<br \/>\nFresh water on island? just rain<br \/>\nCaves? unknown<br \/>\nPLAN = follow shore line and look for caves, check spire first<br \/>\nSpire: Spire not natural! looks it from a distance.

Caramin leaves all the silver they have as an offering &#8211; 424 silvers tucked into the rocks. Get the sense that Dennio power was used to thrust the spire up out of the earth. <\/p>\n<p>We do a march around the island, cursory exploration, find nothing. We are forced to leave the island because of bad weather. We race back to town, in danger of the boat being tossed in a storm. When we return, we re-provision, and Mufasa is thrown into jail for assault and battery &#8211; Caramin does not intervene. Caramin takes the misc. goods and weapons (cutlass, short sword, dagger, hand axe) and donates them to the Elemental temple in town. Caramin gives the elemental priest the ciphered journals to see if he can decipher them. He tells them where we got them. <\/p>\n<p><b>Eric<\/b> [Athol] comes from sailing and merchant background and probably had money in his family at some point. He replaces Mufasa to aid in fighting. Looks like Caribbean descent. <\/p>\n<p><b>Krylin<\/b> [Ben] received a vision outside of town, the vision makes sense when he sees Caramin and delivers &#8220;you missed something&#8221;. He explains his vision of a stone spire out in the ocean, and a false image of something being there that should not be there. Relatives were attached to Nanto &#8211; the spirit of fire. Caramin bows to the gods who obviously brought the holy man hither. Krylin the halfling assumes leadership of the group. <\/p>\n<p>Confirm that tracks went off to the north, someone kneeled and squatted. Eric picks up Krylin and takes him up the spire. The wind buffets them. Eric makes the climb to the top. Silver is still there. Clue is there is something under the spire. We find a plate hidden by debris. Caramin finds a thing at the top of the shrine, a handhold stone moves and it opens the plate in the shrine being held shut. We go down a stone stair case for 5 minutes. Water is running down the walls. We are at sea level, and there is standing water, the stairs go down into. It IS low tide. The hallway leads for a minute and a half underwater to a lighted chamber. The torch is lighting the chamber with a witch green light. Passage leads to a lighted area with non flickering light. Caramin stealths ahead to see whats up. A creatures comes out of the water behind the others and attacks them as Caramin scouts ahead. Another creature appears. They are made of dried seaweed, coral, rock and have 4 eel heads on their back. Gross smell of rotten seaweed when they die. Kylin checks it out (similar to golem &#8211; maybe Dennio and Laussio working together?), while Caramin explores forward.<br \/>\nRoom under the spire &#8211; line where the light ends. At the edge of a shrine. Mess of crystals, rock, etc and splinters light in some pattern?<br \/>\nThrow a shoe in, shoe stops for 15 seconds and then recovers.<br \/>\nTime slows. We enter. Corpse looking thing behind the curtain of light. Its a vampire Casua.<br \/>\nCaramin asks if he has a message for his people &#8211; to the emperor: &#8220;Beware the gifts of other lords.&#8221; From a servant to Achtvaal. Been down for a long time, longer with time dilation. It says the chaos lords are vying for power &#8211; Tyranus especially is rising and has influence in the world more than he ever had before. Cataclysmic power!!! Methran the conqueror is not doing much. Caramin lets down his sanity to commune with the spirits of the place &#8211; reality warps.<br \/>\n1) lose leg or genitalia = resisted<br \/>\n2) drunk = x2 healing rate<br \/>\n3) burn 1 CHA all within 100m = hear as though next to me = resisted<br \/>\n4) Powerful build (1 size larger for carrying capacity)<br \/>\nWe learn that the situation has served its purpose. Insight into Casua; emperor has direct tie to Achtvaal = does not age. Caramin has insights of the emperor throughout time. Caramin offers his arm for blood. The vampire says he was the emperors best friend, helped him get the throne. Wants to kill emperor, but cant remember why.
