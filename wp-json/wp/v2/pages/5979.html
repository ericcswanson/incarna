He had little to recommend him. His father however, sent him away from the chaos of Bar-Innis into the service of Baron Reylen Veff, vassal of the count of west river run &#8211; to the north. When the treachery of Baron Veff&#8217;s family was revealed, only a couple of his retainers made it out alive, with the baron and his wife. The other group, with their children, were all murdered by the count&#8217;s men (though it cannot be proven). Disgraced, he labored in the lands of the earl of Richfield, making his way south and joining up to fight in Tarmysia. He got sick a lot, and missed the most important campaigns and chance to distinguish himself. Finally, when the call went out for more recruits to the Gallants, he was taken. Its been 3 long months of his gut problems getting slowly better &#8211; the Gallants have nursed him back to help and trained and drilled him until it hurts. He was placed to assist the baggage train fo the new elite squad formed of fallen Gallant enemies &#8211; The Blackwell Squad. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Character Name: William &#8220;Billy Boy&#8221; Claye Description: Male, human, age 18, right handed, 170#, 5\u201910\u201d CLASS: FIGHTER (2nd; Fighter) Hit Points: 6, 6 +4 = 16 Strength 14 { +2 } Intelligence 11 {} Wisdom 11 {} Dexterity 12 { +1 } Constitution 14 { +2 } Charisma 11 {} Sanity 12 { +1 } [&hellip;]<\/p>\n<a role=\"link\" class=\"rtp-readmore\" title=\"Read more on William Claye [Original] (Character)\" href=../../../../22http/incarnanet/host/spencer-roehl/characters/william-claye/orig/22_1678968644.html rel=\"nofollow\">Read More \u2192<\/a>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"parent":5783,"menu_order":14,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":[],"categories":[],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/5979"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=5979"}],"version-history":[{"count":2,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/5979\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":5981,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/5979\/revisions\/5981"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/5783"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=5979"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=5979"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=5979"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
