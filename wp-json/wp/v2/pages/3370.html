Light the calumet on the table and follow the smoke to our missing spirit wheel and set us free\u201d.<br \/>\nSmythe needs a rest, so we block the door and rest for the night.<br \/>\nWe light the calumet and the smoke leads to the NW corner of the long house.<br \/>\nIn the morning, we look out the front door and don\u2019t see any Kobalds.<br \/>\nWe go out of the long house and light the calumet.  It leads us NW.  We start out and a Kobald appears and tries to attack Meena but fumbles.<br \/>\nAnother one slings Alta and hits for 6 pts.<br \/>\nAnother one misses Singen.<br \/>\nSeveral more attack (5) but miss.<br \/>\nEera moves toward 2 Kobalds and casts Thunder Wave.  The kobalds fly 10 feet backward and take damage.  We all hear a thunderous boom.<br \/>\nAlta crits.<br \/>\nOne hits Meena.  Meena shoots back but misses.<br \/>\nSingen casts Sleep.  Three kobalds fall asleep.<br \/>\nMeena gets hit again.<br \/>\nEera casts entangle on 3 kobalds hiding behind a building.<br \/>\nAlta misses.<br \/>\nMeena attacks the kobald next to her with her shorts words and hits both.<br \/>\nMeena is hit again and falls unconscious.<br \/>\nWe take out all the kobalds.<br \/>\nSingen heals Meena back 4 pts.<br \/>\nMeena moves to be able to shoot at the kobald in the entanglement and kills the kobald.<br \/>\nThe last 3 are sleeping.  We restrain them and Eera interrogates the first.  He refuses to answer so Eera sinks an antler into it, killing it.  The next kobald is more cooperative.  He says there\u2019s 3 more back at the boat.  Eera kills the second one.  We tell the third one that he must show us his cave.  He gets smart with Eera and she puts out one of his eye.<br \/>\nMeena drinks a healing potion.<br \/>\nWe go to the cave.  It\u2019s dirty.  The kobold says the demon might be sleeping inside.  Eera casts Flame and enters the cave.  We check where the demon sleeps but there is nothing there.  We search but find nothing helpful.<br \/>\nWe will go back to the ship and try to get the other 3 kobalds away from the ship and possibly fight the demon.<br \/>\nWe ask our pet kobald to try to convince his 3 friends to run with him back to the cave.  Before he can say anything, the demon smashes his skull.<br \/>\nEera tries to throw flame at the ice demon, but misses.<br \/>\nMeena is injured by a kobald.<br \/>\nIce Homunculus flies to Meena and tries to bite her.<br \/>\nAlta hits him with her quarterstaff and unarmed strike hitting both.<br \/>\nMeena misses both attacks.<br \/>\nEera blasts him with fire and crits for max damage.<br \/>\nThe kobolds attack but miss.<br \/>\nIce H hits Eera.  She has to make a con check, which she makes.<br \/>\nSingen casts True Strike on Meena.<br \/>\nMeena crits against Ice H and takes him down.  When she tries to attack a kobold, she fumbles and is stunned for one round.<br \/>\nEera takes out a kobold.<br \/>\nA kobold hits Alta.  And another hits her and she goes down.<br \/>\nSingen goes to Alta and gives her a healing potion and gives her Bardic inspiration.<br \/>\nMeena takes out a kobold and injures another.<br \/>\nEera hits the last kobold with a sparkler.<br \/>\nAlta hits the last kobold and kills it.<br \/>\nWe tell the Captain about our mission with the calumet.  He will wait for us.  We light the calumet and the smoke leads us back to the village.  It leads to the body of a kobold in a building adjacent to the longhouse.<br \/>\nWe find the wheel and the crows come back and turn into villagers and the white lady appears.  She asks us to leave the wheel and calumet in the longhouse and leave with their thanks and blessings.  As we leave, a feather falls out of the sky and falls on Eera\u2019s shoulder.<br \/>\nWe start to leave but there is a white out for a few minutes.  When the snow clears, the longhouse is gone.  When Eera touches the feather, she hears the voice of the white lady who says this token will help you in dealing with people.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>World of Ph&#8217;yrin Tys!
