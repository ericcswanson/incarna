A character with a crafted story is a player vested in it&#8217;s success. A story helps to envision characters and bring them to life; these can be a few sentences to dozens of pages. A character story can allow the player to make one which deviates from the rules, allowing a piecemeal approach to fulfill any concept of race, background, vocation, locale, and archetype\/path. Each added story element the player creates adds more rewards.\n<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><i class=\"fa fa-book\"><\/i> This must include vaguely how the character got their general background and the type of life that lead to acquiring vocational or basic life skills and place in the local society.<\/li>\n<li id=\"story-path\"><i class=\"fa fa-trophy\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><\/i> Youngest years &#8211; Family (social status, place, and history), place or birth\/place raised, etc. Who were their parents and siblings, and what role did they play in the character&#8217;s life?<\/li>\n<li><i class=\"fa fa-trophy\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><\/i> A story of growing up &#8211; What was the character like as a child?
