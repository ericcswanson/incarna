His father was never around but for a few months total out of the year &#8211; busy in the far away hills mining. He grew up undisciplined and his mother was a drug addict and died when he was 9. His older brother went off to become a miner like his father and Reynald lost track of all family and had to fend for himself. He was pressured by both gangs in the capital, but was never much of a &#8220;joiner&#8221;. He makes a minor living thieving, picking pockets of the rich, and doing odd jobs. He\u2019s done jobs all over Correl &#8211; in the small towns and villages (better not to interfere with the 2 main gangs of Correl). He makes it clear to any who hire him, he\u2019s not a brawler. Of late, he\u2019s been on the hunt for information &#8211; rumors and knowledge that might allow him to escape his situation. He&#8217;s seeking bigger prospects but his ultimate goal is to set himself up with an Inn or tavern &#8211; he does like a good drink, but is careful to never imbibe too strongly. One night, while at the Three Jacks Inn, he was approached by an eccentric elven mage named MayBug. Word had reached MayBug that Reynald was looking for a larger opportunity. MayBug has a reputation for being strange, but for always getting the job done &#8211; whatever it was &#8211; and sticking by his word. A bit of \u201cdetection\u201d work was what he was famous for, but rumors always put him in the middle of a few scandals, questionable \u201chits\u201d, and a for-hire explorer of ruins. He almost worked with him on a job once, but fortunately one of the gang members was used on a recovery job he was hired for &#8211; he just provided the contact for the fence. The gang member Joey came back with a permanent limp and talked an incredible tale of MayBug\u2019s magery and swordcraft. MayBug said that a group was being formed to work some local problems, and that it involved a druid. A druid? This was admittedly intriguing. MayBug could not say more, but Reynald knew it must be that druid on the north side of the vale that was rumored to be outcast among his own kind for violating orders\u2026 a sad tale of love and loss, but he never betrayed his faith. When asked what role he would play, MayBug insinuated that he was familiar in the ways of \u201ctroubleshooting\u201d. This was code for second-story and stealth skills among the criminal element &#8211; how did MayBug know this? He said they needed someone who could watch their back, and \u2018work through certain obstacles\u2019. Well, MayBug may be odd, but he seemed to know what he was about. He agreed to join MayBug at the Three Jacks Inn in 2 days.<\/p>\n<p>> start Meargensdale Politics campaign<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Human, 5&#8217;8&#8243;, #145, age: 18, handed: right, gender: male, hair: short brown, skin: caucasian (heavily tanned from sun) > Wounds\/Scars: None (minor from fights, nothing debilitating) Class: Rogue (thief) 3rd level Hit Dice: 5,5,5 =15 Hit Points STR 12 (+1 bonus) INT 10 WIS 16 (+3 bonus) DEX 16 (+3 bonus) CON 10 CHA 10 [&hellip;]<\/p>\n<a role=\"link\" class=\"rtp-readmore\" title=\"Read more on Reynald Breyth &#8211; Character\" href=../../../../22http/incarnanet/host/arabus-grenier/chars/reynald-breyth/22_622026502.html rel=\"nofollow\">Read More \u2192<\/a>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"parent":332,"menu_order":57,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":[],"categories":[],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/4863"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=4863"}],"version-history":[{"count":3,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/4863\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":4868,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/4863\/revisions\/4868"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/332"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=4863"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=4863"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=4863"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
