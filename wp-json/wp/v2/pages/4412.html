Father was very rough, broke several bones over the years. On the surface, father was find but he was an abusive tyrant to this family. It turned out he was a secret follower of of the dark god Sun Stealer and killed everyone but William jr. and William&#8217;s mother when The Gallants stumbled upon his secret. His mother was almost killed by his father, but committed suicide the same day when she found out the rest of her family was dead &#8211; she felt she had failed to protect them as a mother. She left a note asking The Gallants to take in her strong son. William had been spending his spare time training with the South Drift militia and has some weapons training under him. He is well known and loved in the area, and sympathy for his plight is great. William had heard of The Gallants from far away in Dunstrand to the south and liked what he had heard. He agreed to take the oath and be sworn in right away. Taelin the half elf &#8211; a commander of their current expedition and senior officer, swore him in the day after he father was killed. Taelin did not seem bad for a half breed- he seemed sincere and controlled &#8211; not at all like the bundle of rage his father had described the half elven kind as. He swore to himself then to trust his own instinct, not what other people said about other folk. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Williams Enders II (jr.)
