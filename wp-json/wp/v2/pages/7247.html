He was thought to be quite insane. He was known to consort with fell entities of the abyss. He believed he could create a &#8220;kingdom&#8221; of the demonic on the new world. Of course, nothing went as planned. Gherbolg was killed and his body torn into a hundred pieces by ravening demons. A set of knights and soldiers attacked the &#8220;nest&#8221; of demons and slew them all in a bloodbath. The pages of the demonicon were scattered and torn. Most were destroyed, but several were caught by the breeze and carried away. <\/p>\n<p>Every time they are found, misfortune follows.  <\/p>\n<p><b>Description<\/b>: The pages are made of the flesh of men, elves, and other sentient creatures. They are wrinkled and cracked, and the skin is split and oozes pus. Inside, the conjurations are written in the blood of the creature matching the skin. Once the pages are used in a ritual, they catch fire and the words burn &#8211; releasing a foul and toxic smoke with a smell from hell. The pages are not consumed though, though they are burned. Only fresh blood will cause them to be whole and legible again.\n<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"The_Ritual_of_Gherbolg%E2%80%99s_Demonology\"><\/span>The Ritual of Gherbolg&#8217;s Demonology<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<ul class=\"nav nav-tabs\">\n<li class=\"active\"><a data-toggle=\"tab\" href=../../../../22_842147072.html><img src=../../../../22/wp-content/uploads/d20png/index_105716085.html style=\"width:14px\"> D20<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a data-toggle=\"tab\" href=../../../../22_842147072.html><img src=../../../../22/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/favicongif/index_1832861513.html alt=\"ICore\" style=\"width:14px\">ICore<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div class=\"tab-content\">\n<div id=\"d20\" class=\"tab-pane fade in active\">\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"D20_Gherbolg%E2%80%99s_Demon_Summons\"><\/span>D20 Gherbolg&#8217;s Demon Summons<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Performing the ritual requires that the character be able to cast ritual spells. If they are not able to, the casting of the spell can still be done with a blood sacrifice of D6\/3 damage (pierce\/slash\/bludgeon) of their own blood. Each time the summons is enacted, the summoner must make a Sanity DC 10 check, -1 for each repeated summoning, or be afflicted with <a href=../../../../22https/roll20net/compendium/dnd5e/Madness_1111963514.html>Madness<\/a> at the end of the summoning. The first time failed it afflicts a Short Term Madness, the second time a Long Term MAdness, and after 3 failures Indefinite Madness. Obviously, this can have an effect on the outcome if the character changes their outlook, breaks a magical warding protecting them, etc. <\/p>\n<p>Time: The ritual takes 24 hour to complete. If the caster does not possess a Constitution of at least 12, they must make a Constitution DC 10 check. If the summoner wants to summon it in a swifter fashion (3 rounds), the blood sacrifice of the summoner must be doubled (or added). Additionally, the summoner and those nearby must be protected by a Magic Circle spell, and it can only be commanded for 1 hour and must remain within sight distance of the summoner. <\/p>\n<p>Sacrifice: At the completion of the ritual, a sacrifice of a medium sized or bigger living creature must accompany it. If the creature is a highly sentient one, the HP for the summoned demon is maximum. <\/p>\n<p>Command: The creature will serve for 24 hours only, and cannot be out of sight distance of the summoner. If the summoner has the protection of a Magic Circle spell, it can command the demon for a single task as well &#8211; one which must be able to be completed within 1 week. After these time limits, the demon returns to the abyss. <\/p>\n<p>Repeated Summons: Each time the same demon is summoned, it take D6\/3 additional blood sacrifice to enact it &#8211; eventually it would kill the summoner to do it. <\/p>\n<p>Entities:<br \/>\n1) Type 1 Demon: <a href=../../../../22https/wwwaideddorg/dnd/monstres_php_522462230.html>Barlguras<\/a><\/p>\n<p>2) Type 1 Demon: <a href=../../../../22https/wwwaideddorg/dnd/monstres_php_106043707.html>Vrock<\/a>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"icore\" class=\"tab-pane fade\">\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Incarna_Gherbolg%E2%80%99s_Demon_Summons\"><\/span>Incarna Gherbolg&#8217;s Demon Summons<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Gherbolg was a mage who was known to be following in Orlec&#8217;s (the wizard) path. not an apprentice, but rather more of an &#8220;admirer&#8221;.
