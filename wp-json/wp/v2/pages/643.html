There are different ways of encouraging approaches and reward methods which can be employed, but the biggest thing to remember is educating the players on how to advance. <a href=../../../../22/characters/index_391400231.html>Character points<\/a>  If players have incentive, most will try and tailor their play towards getting the most rewards. In addition to CP, <a href=../../../../22/character/index_391461159.html>Action Points<\/a> should also be given in reward, usually a like amount, to allow characters to take chances they may not normally take or ensure success at a critical point.\n<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"personal-reward\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Personal_Rewards\"><\/span>Personal Rewards<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Game session times and occurrences will vary. The more point rewards given, the faster the characters will develop. This pace determines the challenges they will face and set the difficulty of play. Keep this in mind. If you have a group that meets 2-3 times a week, the life-cycle development of the characters is going to be fast. It is suggested that lower CP rewards be given and higher AP. Place them in situations where they need the AP to survive and focus<br \/>\non the story development rather than character skill progress. Unless you want them to develop swiftly &#8211; then the rewards should be increased or kept average if the frequency of gaming sessions alone provides quick advancement. <i>Remember too that poor <a href=../../../../22http/enwikipediaorg/wiki/Role-playing/index_1316432226.html>role-playing<\/a> should not be rewarded. Reduction of AP (personal and\/or group) is the best way to penalize for this. The character continues to develop at the same rate, but their opportunities are reduced. <\/i>\n<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Character_Points\"><\/span>Character Points<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Participation: Average suggested reward guidelines for a game session should be as follows: 1 CP for showing up; 2 CP for active participation; 3 CP for a full game session with active participation.\n<li>Development: Reducing the costs of achieving a new level in a well used skills by <a href=../../../../22/game/char/index_71643245.html>allocating<\/a> towards a specific ability used often and effectively are also appropriate. <\/li>\n<li>Survival: Particularly physically challenging situations may grant a small, one time bonus to HP. A single point is the maximum reward unless it represents extreme duration or conditions. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Action_Points\"><\/span>Action Points<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>For extraordinary participation, excellent <a href=../../../../22http/enwikipediaorg/wiki/Role-playing/index_1316432226.html>role-playing<\/a>, or long duration.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2 id=\"group-reward\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Group_Rewards\"><\/span>Group Rewards<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>\nOther rewards can be fuel for aptitude powers, blessings for faith characters, money or items for characters. <\/p>\n<div data-role=\"collapsible\" data-collapsed-icon=\"arrow-r\" data-expanded-icon=\"arrow-d\" data-theme=\"b\" data-content-theme=\"a\">\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Reward_Ideas\"><\/span>Reward Ideas<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Other than in-game rewards of characters gaining items and loot, both CP and AP need to be rewarded to allow characters to continue to develop and grow.<br \/>\nBoth of these need to be considered. Character points allows players to take new skills or traits, improve existing ones,<br \/>\nimprove attributes and take powers and abilities. Action points allow characters to take risks above and beyond the normal,<br \/>\nor add syltistic falir, or even secure success in critical conditions. These create flavor and enhance storyline development and make the character feel more vested in the play dynamic.<br \/>\nAlso check out the <a href=../../../../22/game/play/group/22_1142316155.html data-ajax=\"false\">group play incentive mechanics<\/a>. Rewards are generally given per session, and based on a combination of factors.\n<\/p>\n<p><strong>Allocated CP Rewards:<\/strong> A GM rewards a character with a CP to <a href=../../../../22/game/char/22_722607903.html>allocate<\/a> towards something specific. Perhaps they were very lucky and made 9 of 10 PER checks,<br \/>\nand the GM decides to encourage the development in that direction. They can tell the character that they have 1 CP extra allocated towards improving their PER. This is a way of nudging characters<br \/>\nto develop along lines that they use constantly and that fit their characters. The extent to which a GM does this for traits, attributes, and skills is up to them.\n<\/p>\n<p><strong>Reward Incentives<\/strong>: Creating incentives also allows players to target their character&#8217;s interactions to gain more rewards. In addition to the<br \/>\n<a href=../../../../22/game/play/group/22_1142316155.html>group play dynamic<\/a>, give players specific knowledge about specific activities to encourage them to participate. This can be both player out of game actions<br \/>\n(such as writing back stories, keeping up their character records, even bringing food, drink and supplies for others at the sessions), as well as character based in game actions<br \/>\nslaying X foes, avoiding X encounter, gaining X fame or notoriety, etc.).\n<\/p>\n<p><strong>Items, Knowledge, and Powers<\/strong>: Sometimes, its appropriate for formal rewards (given in appreciation for their efforts, as opposed to discovered or accumulated through an <a href=../../../../22http/enwikipediaorg/wiki/Adventure_(role-playing_games)/index_1614176852.html>adventure<\/a>)<br \/>\nto be in the from of items, knowledge or abilities. Items can be technology, back-up goods, property, housing, or even paid for cost-of-living. This may be part of the story or something the GM<br \/>\njust feels is appropriate to aid the party in stabilizing them. Information can also be crucial &#8211; both as a way of removing blocks to forward story progress, the provide an edge, introduce new plot angles, or<br \/>\neven to distract or lure the party into misadventure! Powers and abilities may be given in reward through institutions, brotherhoods, divine surces, or simply as a result of particularly<br \/>\nlarge scale efforts which the party helped to facilitate. Adding toughness to characters at the end of a military campaign could be a free reward &#8211; just the natural result of spending half a year on campaign with an army.\n<\/p>\n<p>In summary, rewards should always be given with the thought of the speed of progression and campaign context. A particularly violent and dangerous one may necessitate more AP, and a group that meets 3 times a week should be given less each session because otherwise the characters progress too fast. Any rewards in terms of items and valuables should always be balanced between the power of foes and puzzles you want to present and the ease with which you expect the group to deal with them. A group not doing particularly well in collecting technology and items to help them could be rewarded by a sponsor or political figure who championed their cause; excessive accumulation can be brought down with intrigue, taxation, theft, natural disaster, etc.\n<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Merit_System\"><\/span>Merit System<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>One of the ways a GM can set a specific benchmark or bar is to create a merit based set of rewards. Merit can be based on accomplishment in battle, fame, or just a mission completed. In return for achieving a specific level of merit, the GM distributes rewards. This could be a military brotherhood rewarding with goods, coin, or access to services and items. It may be a church, or a Duke or King. Regardless of which institution or specific set of goals, the GM defines them and documents them, rewarding players when they reach the goals with promised, documented gains. The specifics of it all are entirely up to the GM and player to work out.<br \/>\nAn example of a merit system is the <a href=../../../../22/set/srlm/campaign/bannermenhtml/index_421951359.html>Bannermen Merit System<\/a> of the Steel Realms.\n<\/p>\n<p>You have to adjust it to the # of characters. Remember that not everyone should get a medal for a battle\/event\/mission &#8211; so dont feel compelled to give everyone a low merit rating medal unless the merit totals per level are so high its needed.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>All players expect rewards for a gaming session &#8211; its how progress is measured.
