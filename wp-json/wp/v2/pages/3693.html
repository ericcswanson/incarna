Perhaps not something to notice among a large city\u2019s population, but it is significant to our town. People are afraid to walk the streets even during the day, and merchants of stopped coming for fear a grisly death awaits them like their companion Frodrich. As mayor, I can no longer ignore the failure of the constabulary to solve and deal with this issue&#8230; trade is our life blood.

The party should just lost the other item or think it was already there and looks just like it. They will be lead to believe that someone slipped in during the fight and got away with it. <\/p>\n<p>No more murders will happen. <\/p>\n<p>One of the PC\u2019s items will vanish when they get back to Dunstrand. <\/p>\n<p>There are many sulphur springs in the hills&#8230; there are indeed horrible beasts though that call them home. <\/p>\n<p>The serpent people still inhabit the ravines and caves &#8211; but the sulphur springs makes them lethargic. They awaken only once a generation, raid the communities of bandits and \u201cfree men\u201d in the night and return to the deep &#8211; which perpetuates the myth of some great beast slumbering in the hills. Of course, there is a beast &#8211; Cruthnak D\u2019chp &#8211; a foul denizen of the shadowrealms summoned forth by the Sea Kings thousands of years ago, a sea serpent which crawled upon the land, hidden away from its enemies my masking its stench among the sulphur springs. Like a dragon, it sleeps the sleep of ages, but its dream are powerful &#8211; having subjugated the will of the Ameni Apep &#8211; the snake people, who worship its ghostly dream-vision as a god. Only the High King\u2019s rangers are known to walk among the people of this land without fear &#8211; for reasons known only to them.<\/p>\n<p>The wizard has made a deal with Lord Black &#8211; he will use his powers to terrorize the coast and divide Southgap\u2019s forces. All he wants is access to the new Shrine of Elancil to sacrifice for and commune with the goddess.<br \/>\nIf the party explores this first, they must travel to Amarit, the only coastal city in Southgap.<br \/>\nThere is a vessel, flying the flag of Tranicos &#8211; and ancient admiral of the Sea Kings, attacking coastal trade ships and raiding hamlets and travelers along the coast. The Tranicos was said to have buried treasure nearby, but no one has ever found it. He was said to be bloody and without mercy, and utterly ruthless in his quest for a cure for death.<\/p>\n<p>If the party has killed Lord Black, these raid will stop 1 week later once word gets to Therajay. If the party has cleaned up Queen\u2019s Hotvale, it will be attacked and sacked &#8211; all staff on the ship will have moved to that location and be guarding it in full readiness while Therajay tries to compel the serpent to give him the knowledge he seeks. <\/p>\n<p>There are a few options for dealing with the \u201cpirates\u201d:<br \/>\n1. A \u201cbait\u201d ship<br \/>\n2. pPsing as merchant caravan on road to Cabella.<br \/>\n3. Wait at a hamlet for another raid.<\/p>\n<p>Bait Ship &#8211; this is most dangerous for a party not good at fighting in boats.<br \/>\nCaravan &#8211; it may take a week or more before they are attacked; 5% chance in day, 20% chance at night but by deadlings.<br \/>\nHamlet wait &#8211; happens in 3 days<\/p>\n<p>They have summoned back the spirit of Tracino (a minor spirit they are using to control the voice &#8211; not really his) and risen a few platoons of \u201cdeadlings\u201d (zombies). they present as Elancil in order to make the dead sea-king lord more fearsome and his spirit&#8217;s return more believable.<\/p>\n<p>Dimitri Volashanka (Malek follower) bought a crystal in Karolak. In reality it is a portal\/window to the dreamworld and spirits, but they spread the rumor it contained the soul of the pirate king Tracino. The amulet did contain a spirit &#8211; the spirit of Tracino&#8217;s wizard &#8216;Therajay&#8217;. Therajay was able to possess Dimitri &#8211; a minor noble and dabbler in the art of the magi from Karolak. He was cast out for his pursuit of darker spells, seeking knowledge of the shadow realms.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; dreams\/nightmares (taps into the sleeping World Serpent\u2019s power &#8211; the wizard in control of Dimitri knwos its there from olden times and that the shrine\u2019s divine beacon\/power would be his only way of communicating with the beast &#8211; he seeks knowledge of creatures and spells to summon them the Sea Serpents were said to use, taught by Elancil herself to her children)<\/p>\n<p>3) Tracino &#8211; An ancient sea-king banner of a lord long dead<\/p>\n<p> CAVE:<br \/>\nA defile leads downward into the earth.

Suspended in time and space &#8211; staring at a glittering stone, gaunt but not dead.<\/p>\n<p>The root of the Evil &#8211; putting a stop to the Sea Serpent<br \/>\nThe Lord of Southgap himself will receive the party in a banquet and personally ask them \u201cTo root out the source of this evil!\u201d His scribes have translated the text, Valdeysian in origin (the tongue of the Sea-Kings), and it appears there is an ancient evil which dwells deep in the earth. He wants you to lead an expedition back into Ungaard to search for this person hiding there. Without the need to protect the roads anymore, his army of guards and mercenaries numbers some 250 that he will send. Such a show of force will quell any grumblings from the Balveeni &#8211; who he expects to submit to his will. Surely someone among them knows the name he is seeking. <\/p>\n<p>Maiden (title of Isir, Celestial) Leiyos of Arundel<br \/>\nShes tries to warn the party \u201cYou are uncovering that which the gods desire to remain buried! Evil awakened will fester like an open wound&#8230; leave it be.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Visitations from the Apparition of the serpent!<\/p>\n<p>You leave the reltive safety of the daylight and well marked roads of Southgap, entering into the forbidding shadows and crags of Ungaard. You guides have been selected by the representatives of those you wish to treat with to lead to arranged meeting places. The Lord of Southgap has allowed the party to determine the pace and schedule of the travel, taking as much time to search out the evil in Ungaard as they need (within reason). If they dont care to specify, have them go in this order:<\/p>\n<p>Angry Boar Tradepost &#8211; A meeting place for the \u201cFree peoples\u201d of Ungaard<br \/>\nOmIicha and Peg still retain control of this place. The pay no tribute but host the gathering and send on the party\u2019s retinue well provisioned. They have definitely heard the name somewhere. They believe that when Lord Black met with the pirate Dimitri, that the name was mentioned. <\/p>\n<p>Basscrick &#8211; Central town to the Urop Balveen<br \/>\n> Llenygash is the new chief among the Balveen &#8211; he pays in a few otter pelts, salt, and amber. No one in the clan remembers hearing the name. <\/p>\n<p>Stonedour &#8211; Home of the Shadowlie Clan<br \/>\n> Perem Dhal is the new clan leader &#8211; he pays crude tribute in gold and silver ore. He does not know the name the party is searching for but when the party asks, a PER check will allow them to hear the gasp of Ryingril &#8211; daughter of Ucaz &#8211; the last clan leader. She will be brought forth and the tale beaten out of her. She and her forbidden lover were using the lower reaches on night when Ucaz\u2019s booming voice was heard. Her lover ended their tryst and ran, but she followed him. He and a stranger went deep into the caves, into the place where me are not allowed to go &#8211; where the darkness makes you swoon (The deeping). On the edges of this evil place, she swears her father met with a dark snake-like creature which had arms. The stranger with him translated for them and while she knows not what transpired there was some sort of pact made for the stranger gave a few leather packets to the snake person. She woke up in her room, believing it all to be a dream and never spoke of it. She can lead the party to the place<\/p>\n<p>Rauch Gulch &#8211; Home of the Grey Ungarth clan<br \/>\n> Vormor is the new clan leader and will accept the peace &#8211; he pays in liquor, butter, some fine pelts of bear and obsidian.<\/p>\n<p>Amorose Hollow &#8211; A meeting place of the \u201cFree Peoples\u201d of Ungaard<\/p>\n<p>The party must venture into The Deeping, and find the kobold\u2019s sacred chamber to commune with the beast.<\/p>\n<p>Ryingril knows a secret path only the clan leaders know &#8211; it is a direct path through The Deeping (affects still may last beyond it though). It leads into a chute that drops into a corridor on the edge of the kobold ruins. There are 2 rubble chocked passages that need to have many rocks moved before someone can squirm through, including the initial one connecting to the Clan Chiefs private chamber area. Her father had ordered his guards out of the area for the night. <\/p>\n<p>Holvist Na Bred\u2019n &#8211; a Deepworth type construction favored by Kobolds (all Dumastorian really) is a ruin. It is a place where the snake people, Ucaz and Dimitri met. The name of the place is roughly \u201cPlace of Rest on the Edge of Sleep\u201d &#8211; it is a circular, ring type layout. The rubble and unfamilair architecture make the Ameni Apep nervous and uncomfortable, but there are no kobolds left. The snake folk will try and prevent anyone from gaining entry&#8230; but will not follow them into the ruins. <\/p>\n<p>4 snake people guarding entrance to the ruins. They will try and use guile, charm, and (sleep; lethargy if resisted) poison arrows.<\/p>\n<p>Temple to Him Under the Mountain<\/p>\n<p>Ducateon with the party can attempt to make prayers and offerings of silver and gold to invoke his power.
