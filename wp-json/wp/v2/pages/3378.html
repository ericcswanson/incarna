Modax helps her.<br \/>\nMeena feels she must return to Portent Downs and report to Spider Brass.  The others decide to go with her.  We take a small boat to a larger town.  We cannot enter the town as they have the plague.  All food for our next passage on a larger ship to the mainland, is not going through town.  They are being very careful not to cross contaminate.  It is an inconvenience, but better than catching the plague.  We are on the dock 4 days.<br \/>\nA large ship comes in and for 10 GP we book passage right away for Portent downs.<br \/>\nThe captain (Capt. Johnny Warhorse) asks to see us.  He tells us they were not able to resupply in town, but there is plenty of ale.  The ship is named \u201cThe Devil\u2019s Mistress\u201d.<br \/>\nWe notice there are a row of skulls tied on the side of the ship.  We don\u2019t recognize them.
