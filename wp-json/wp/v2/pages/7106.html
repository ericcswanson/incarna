You can choose the form that this melee weapon takes each time you create it (see the Weapons section for weapon options). You are proficient with it while you wield it. This weapon counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. Your pact weapon disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more. It also disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss the weapon (no action required), or if you die.<br \/>\n<b>Martial Adept<\/b> (D6\/3 superiority dice, 2 maneuvers)<br \/>\n > Lunging Attack. When you make a melee weapon attack on your turn, you can expend one superiority die to increase your reach for that attack by 5 feet. If you hit, you add the superiority dieto the attack\u2019s damage roll.<br \/>\n > Sweeping Attack. When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to damage another creature with the same attack. Choose another creature within 5 feet of the original target and within your reach. If the original attack roll would hit the second creature, it takes damage equal to the number you roll on your superiority die. The damage is of the same type dealt by the original attack.<\/p>\n<p><b>Healing Hands<\/b>: As an action, you can touch a creature and cause it to regain a number of hit points equal to your level.

Your transformation lasts for 1 minute or until you end it as a bonus action. During it, you have a flying speed of 30 feet, and once on each of your turns, you can deal extra radiant damage to one target when you deal damage to it with an attack or a spell. The extra radiant damage equals your level. During this time, all allies within 30&#8242; also gain the bonus damage on any spells or attacks they make that cause Radiance damage. Once you use this trait, you can&#8217;t use it again until you finish a long rest.<br \/>\n<b>Healing Light of the Dawn<\/b>: At 1st level, you gain the ability to channel celestial energy to heal wounds. You have a pool of [1 + your warlock level.] d6s that you spend to fuel this healing. As a bonus action, you can heal one creature you can see within 60 feet of you, spending dice from the pool (maximum dice equals your Sanity modifier (minimum of one die). You may also expend one D6 to give yourself +2 AC for 3 rounds. Your pool regains all expended dice when you finish a long rest.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Magic\"><\/span>Magic<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Occult Aptitude: 1 \/ <b>Mana<\/b>: 3<\/p>\n<h4><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Short_Rest_Powers\"><\/span>Short Rest Powers<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n<p>Detect Magic (when ritualized detection becomes a Bonus Action instead, and last an additional 10 minutes * Occult Aptitude)<\/p>\n<h4><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Long_Rest_Powers\"><\/span>Long Rest Powers<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n<p>Feather Fall<\/p>\n<p>Cantrips: [3 + Sacred Flame, Dancing Lights, &#038; Light] True Strike, Blade Ward, Chill Touch<br \/>\nSpell Slots = 2 \/ Spell Level = 2 (all spells cast through 2nd level slot); return after Short\/Long Rest<br \/>\nSpells Known: [5+1] Armor of Agathys, Hex, Guiding Bolt, Cure Light Wounds, Darkness<br \/>\n> Occult Aptitude: Hellish Rebuke<br \/>\nInvocations: Devil\u2019s Sight (darkvision 120&#8242; &#8211; even in magical darkness), Fiendish Vigor (+6 HP) False Life at will<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Combat\"><\/span>Combat<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Resistance: Necrotic and Radiant damage<br \/>\nArmor:<br \/>\nStudded Leather of [Fire] Resistance (Demon Hide from slain foe +1 AC, 1 [greater] Resilience) = AC: 16<br \/>\n> Can expend one D6 of Healing Light of the Dawn to grant +2 AC for 3 rounds = AC 18<br \/>\nWeapons:<br \/>\n<b>Short Swords of the Umbral Sunrise<\/b><br \/>\nShortsword, considered magical damage and silvered (mirror like surface), +1 Attack, +1 Initiative; #1 Detects Fiends 60\u2019, #2 Detect Undead 60\u2019; Radiant Soul effect works on both blades at once &#038; treated as single pact weapon, and double the healing if blades placed at head and foot, +2 Initiative (replaces +1)\/Max superiority dice for maneuvers if both blades are used in same round; Requires Attunement &#8211; Good Alignment only or will damage the holders. <\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Tactics\"><\/span>Tactics<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>He lives for the glory of righteous combat.

An aasimar inevitably draws the attention of evil cultists, fiends, and other enemies of good, all of whom would be eager to strike down a celestial champion if they had the chance. When traveling, aasimar prefer hoods, closed helms, and other gear that allows them to conceal their identities.<br \/>\nPersonality: I don&#8217;t pay attention to the risks in a situation.

He grew up training for combat, and to protect the stronghold of light against the forces of evil. He began his study as a troubleshooter &#8211; developing rogue skills to counter those trying to sneak into the stronghold. His successes there allowed him to graduate to fighting as a soldier under the host of Devas against the constant attacks from fiend and abyssal slaves. His services for his patron took him to the newly formed world of Orlec. He earned his armor in fights against fiends. He quested for the Umbral Sunrise blades in the ruins of an ancient Azer fortress. He killed dozens of minor demons, and eventually won free and flew from the highest ramparts to escape their clutches. On his day or promotion he was given the option to leave the bright lands and walk among the humans. He chose the later, to see strange and new opportunities and experience a whole new life. <\/p>\n<p>Meeting <a href=../../../../22http/incarnanet/host/kelly-berger/char/icrane/22_1109026926.html>Icrane<\/a>:<br \/>\nHis patron sent him forth, having finished his service for his pact. He returned to Orlec &#8211; he was slightly familiar with that. His patron told him that the stars aligned for his best fortune at the place Icrane was staying. Icrane was translating an ancient text -the Ritual of the Dark Sun. Initially startled and hostile to a being of light appearing next to him, the peaceful response calmed him. He asked if he had been sent by Medja, Jrolmandir told him &#8220;in a way, yes&#8230; i myself am but a soldier in the army of the celestial heavens and hear i have been put to do the most good&#8221;. Icrane, having seen so much mystical meddling and occurrences, simply shrugged it off and took it all in stride. He helped Icrane translate the celestine text of the ritual and fill in missing translated elements with his native fluency. This allowed Icrane to solve the last cipher and details of the ritual and offer it to the group. <\/p>\n<p>In a Coven:<br \/>\nWith <a href=../../../../22http/incarnanet/host/kelly-berger/char/icrane/22_1109026926.html>Icrane<\/a> &#8211; his work in the text of the ritual of the dark sun was enough for Icrane to believe that they could form a coven with 2 others. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Rogue 2nd\/Warlock 4th [Celestial Patron\/Pact of Blade]; Harpys Messengers Coven Member Hit Dice: 8, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4 = 28 + 12 [CON] = 40 -1 Blood Oath\/Bond = 39 HP Essence: -5 Occult Aptitude, -1 Coven, -2 Warlock Strength: 10 Intelligence: 10 Wisdom: 13 [+1] Dexterity: 16 [+3] Constitution: 14 [+2] Charisma: 16 [&hellip;]<\/p>\n<a role=\"link\" class=\"rtp-readmore\" title=\"Read more on Jrolmandir\" href=../../../../22http/incarnanet/host/corey-cordray/chars/jrolmandir/22_2137290039.html rel=\"nofollow\">Read More \u2192<\/a>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"parent":338,"menu_order":5,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":[],"categories":[],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/7106"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=7106"}],"version-history":[{"count":17,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/7106\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":7229,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/7106\/revisions\/7229"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/338"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=7106"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=7106"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=7106"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
