Little is known about the source of the eye or where they found it, but it is thought to be tied to a creature native to the plane of Pandemonium. The eye was identified as likely to be the eye of a daemon of some sort, a creature named Iupschtalk, of foul disposition and temperament. Following a series of omens and portents, Kampfer and <a href=../../../../22http/incarnanet/host/kelly-berger/char/icrane/22_1109026926.html title=\"\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"\" class=\"\">Icrane&#8217;s<\/a> paths crossed. Using his connection to nature, Kampfer was able to rid himself of it. The eye was passed on from Kampfer to the sorcerer Icrane &#8211; Kampfer was granted a vision in which Icrane achieved lasting change and helped to keep the balance of nature with it in greater ways than he. Icrane was angry, he felt that Kampfer was placing too much responsibility on him. Icrane wanted nothing to do with Merowey or the events unfolding there&#8230; with his soon to be wife, he was trying to strike out again in a small trading settlement. But alas, the guilt he felt over abandoning his old friends would overtake him eventually. Though it cost him [in permanent damage], Icrane agreed to attune the eye. Kampfer was explicit in that it looked far worse than it felt &#8211; and his soothing words made Icrane believe it was worth the sacrifice. <\/p>\n<p>DESCRIPTION: The eye appears to be some sort of cloudy, red-orange lizard-like eye. It does not look natural, no matter the make up, lens or what is applied to soften its appearance. The skin around the socket becomes dry and cracked unless treated constantly. The eye does not wither and die if it is plucked from its possessor&#8217;s head &#8211; it stays the same regardless. It will not provide normal eyesight by replacing a missing or damaged eye, though it will size to fit nearly any eye socket. <\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Attuned_Powers\"><\/span>Attuned Powers<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>REQUIREMENTS: Attunement (Occult) and placement in an empty eye socket.<br \/>\n> If the character does not have a professional perform the extraction of their own eye, it will cause 1 permanent HP of damage.<br \/>\n<b>Otherworldly Visions<\/b>: The character can peer into strange realms, drawing on the visions, events and power there.

It takes 1 full round for the swarm to travel (it cannot attack until the next round). The type of Swarm is chosen by the character; is controlled using a Bonus Action each round, requires Concentration, has double HP, an additional +10&#8242; movement, and covers a 20&#8242; cube centered up to 60&#8242; away when cast. It lasts for their Divine or Occult Aptitude in rounds or a minimum of 1.

If they fail the Contact Other Plane save and the psychic damage would kill the character, instead they take enough damage to drop them to 1, and gain a Major Wound and a measure of Exhaustion until they get a Long Rest. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Swarm_Options_of_the_Eye\"><\/span>Swarm Options of the Eye<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=../../../../22https/roll20net/compendium/dnd5e/Swarm of Bats_645548136.html>Swarm of Bats<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=../../../../22https/roll20net/compendium/dnd5e/Swarm of Insects_1310677510.html>Swarm of Insects<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=../../../../22https/roll20net/compendium/dnd5e/Swarm of Poisonous Snakes_508787746.html>Swarm of Poisonous Snakes<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=../../../../22https/roll20net/compendium/dnd5e/Swarm of Spiders_1377320984.html>Swarm of Spiders<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=../../../../22https/roll20net/compendium/dnd5e/Swarm of Rats_913983592.html>Swarm of Rats<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=../../../../22https/roll20net/compendium/dnd5e/Swarm of Ravens_1483431689.html>Swarm of Ravens<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>A <a href=../../../../22https/roll20net/compendium/dnd5e/Swarm of Quippers_1158423837.html>Swarm of Quippers<\/a> if in water.\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Technically not the actual eye of of Orlec, it was the eye grafted onto him at the loss of his own by a band of otherworldly slavers.
