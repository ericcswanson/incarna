The monks have predicted that with the raid thwarted the forces seeking to cast down the monastery will begin a series of probing battles. There are not enough monks to risk, and the modrones do not have a critical enough eye for suances of the battlefield, so the monks will ask the party to fight with the modrones and record what they see. They need only stay in battle for 5 rounds, with each PC taking at least one round of full observation (defense only; maneuvers or actions which do not target individual attacks) to assess later. <\/p>\n<p>This time they fight with a pentatarch, and he shows them the slaad control gems and heart stones are for and how to harvest them. <\/p>\n<p>Page = 61 DMG<br \/>\nThere is a Gray Slaad that PC\u2019s will concentrate on. It carries a satchel of devil skin (immune to flame) which has a treatise of Githzeri and slaad; it contains a mention of an ancient location on a map. IF the monastery grounds (map in library) is overlaid, it shows an area where nothing is shown on the modern version.. An old barracks\/guard tower. Its been razed in a raid millenium ago and never recovered.It says there is a Treatise on the Maker Mystic powers in Slaadi raiding party supposedly can be found there &#8211; with notes of \u201cLong has the hated Gith land stood against the birth waters of entropy, but the means of its undoing is at hand!\u201d<\/p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<br \/>\nOverlight Realm of the Animus Font Land of Ecaslon) &#8211; It will unravel at end.<\/p>\n<p>Time is critical &#8211; if the PC\u2019s dont use everyone to convince the Modrone troops (if they dont see the whole party, they wont think they are truly commited) they will not be able to rally.<br \/>\nRally the Modrones to Prevent Overrun<\/p>\n<p>Create Defenses in each Six Realms<br \/>\nGet the guardians out!<\/p>\n<p>Wild Surges on battlefield with each class power used!<br \/>\nUnless PC\u2019s can summon a mass of lesser extraplanar creatures or a really powerful one, they fight a delaying action. <\/p>\n<p>The monastery will disintegrate and the survivors will pick up the PC\u2019s in the chaos laden shattered battlefield<br \/>\n= creep cool fights in zero G, flame, ice, wild shit!<br \/>\nSanity = important!<br \/>\nAllows PC\u2019s to pick up random race and class trait for affliction of random event on al within 30\u2019<\/p>\n<p>The Fall is Inevitable<br \/>\nThe monks believe it is only a matter of time before it falls. They do not want it to become a point of power for the Slaad &#8211; this would be disastrous. The destruction of the ancient sigils that hold the monastery will allow the Animus Font to be controlled directly, like a massive psychic canon which could be wielded against the realms by the Slaad. The old guardian is weak, but commands legions of modrones. The items within the monastery can provide a defense for a while &#8211; but the monastery will be cut off from help, and eventually must fall. It must be controlled correctly so the Animus Font collapses as well. <\/p>\n<p>Once the monks witness the defeat of the Sacred One and the guardians, they know that they cannot hold back the tide. Monastery will be sacked. The monks don&#8217;t care about the place &#8211; they will move on. They don&#8217;t want to accumulate, and the guardians themselves are the living record if they can be preserved despite defeat, so the party can grab whatever as long as they work within their parameters- everything else will be destroyed in a \u201cscorched earth\u201d finale.
