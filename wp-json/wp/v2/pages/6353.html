There is only a single monastery to the order, that is in the small Duchy of Fandelok within the heartlands, south of Dunstrand. They are primarily the &#8220;guard arm&#8221; for the White Sisters, but escort any of the orders of Aerna where needed. There are only a few hundred to begin with, it takes a decade of practice before initiates are allowed to leave the order and be considered &#8220;safe&#8221; in regards to the code of non-violence.\n<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"history\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"History\"><\/span>History<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<div>Originally established in 9128.<\/div>\n<p>Spirit Brother Aidem converted to following Aerna in 9117, at the age of 38. He had been trained in Ten Swords Academy of the Vale Evander, in the way of the Ten Points style of unarmed combat &#8211; a rare form of unarmed martial arts. Traveling as an attendant to the White Sisters he put his mind to adapting his unarmed knowledge to the precepts of Aerna. &#8220;Spill No Blood&#8221; &#8211; This precept the followers of Aerna must obey, to the death. And so, Aidem worked for years to create a style of unarmed fighting that would satisfy the church of Aerna (although it is still highly controversial). Pressure points, nerve strikes, locks, bars, and even a few throws and stunning blows. The methods were tested in the bandit heavy southlands for 5 years, protecting the White Sisters in the hot lands of the south in their journeys to heal commoners and assisting them in serving the druids to heal the land. It was considered a success.\n<\/p>\n<p>It is so controversial that the order was founded with a charter that expires in 100 years. If the authorities find fault, it will be dissolved entirely at that point.\n<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"The_Code_of_the_Ghosts_of_Conscience\"><\/span>The Code of the Ghosts of Conscience<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>The members of the order swear to adhere to the principles of non-violence, no bloodshed, and conflict avoidance. If they violate their code, they lose their Monk class abilities until they can atone. If a life was lost, they must save a life in exchange.\n<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Violence is the last solution to any problem. Violence is never an answer unless it is in defense and all other options have been exhausted.<\/li>\n<li>Torture is prohibited, unless at the direction of a Dame Mother and there is no permanent damage done.<\/li>\n<li>No blood shall be shed. No weapons are to be used &#8211; only the empty fist, and only in defense or to protect the innocent. Defense shall only be used to incapacitate, unless the foe is immune to such restraints.<\/li>\n<li>A foe may be an enemy, but that does not warrant death. Death is the provenance only of those who who are legally empowered to mete out justice and enforce the laws. Intervention to prevent death, even at the cost of personal harm and against allies, must be done to ensure a life is not lost.<\/li>\n<li><b>I shall not knowingly or willfully take a life, nor cause by action direct or indirect cause a life to be taken.<\/b> I shall stand against my brethren if they forsake this oath, because violence begets violence in an unending cycle if it is not broken.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul class=\"nav nav-tabs\">\n<li class=\"active\"><a data-toggle=\"tab\" href=../../../../22_842147072.html><img src=../../../../22/wp-content/uploads/d20png/index_105716085.html style=\"width:14px\"> D20<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a data-toggle=\"tab\" href=../../../../22_842147072.html><img src=../../../../22/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/favicongif/index_1832861513.html alt=\"ICore\" style=\"width:14px\">ICore<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div class=\"tab-content\">\n<div id=\"d20\" class=\"tab-pane fade in active\">\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"D20_Order_Information\"><\/span>D20 Order Information<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Members of the order are Human only.<\/li>\n<li>The Class is Monk &#8211; this must be their first and primary class.<\/li>\n<li>They may have no other classes, unless they get dispensation from a Dame Mother of Aerna.<\/li>\n<li>They are all devoted to the Way of the Open Fist.<\/li>\n<li>All damage done is non-lethal. If a character of the order strikes a &#8220;killing blow&#8221; it is non lethal and only knocks the subject unconscious.<\/li>\n<li><b>Wholeness of Body<\/b>: This can be used a number of additional times per Long Rest equal to the character&#8217;s Constitution modifier (minimum 1).<\/li>\n<li>Deflection: They cannot return the projectile, but they can spend the Ki instead to channel kinetic energy, knocking the target back by a number of feet equal to the damage negated, on a failed Dexterity save.<\/li>\n<li><b>Beacon of Light<\/b>: The character, at 3rd level, can use 1 point of Ki to cast the Light cantrip on themselves, and it only shines as a white light that counts as Radiance (if other effects operate on Radiance). It cannot be dispelled, though darkness can counter it. <\/li>\n<li><b>Bond of Life<\/b>: If the character throws themselves in the way of a killing blow, they will gain a Blessing of Aerna. Their blessing pool [maximum] is increased by their Monk level &#8211; like a cleric&#8217;s.<\/li>\n<li>If the character takes the Grappler Feat, on a major success, they impose 1 cumulative level of Exhaustion, in addition to Restrained condition. This lasts for 10 rounds. It cannot kill, but can render unconscious. Also, the character may use Dexterity 13 instead of Strength requirement for the Feat.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"icore\" class=\"tab-pane fade\">\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Incarna_Core_Trait_List\"><\/span>Incarna Core Trait List<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"popmapsrlm\" class=\"hidden\"><a href=../../../../22/wp-content/uploads/srlm-map-handgif/index_1662929950.html><img src=../../../../22/wp-content/uploads/srlm-map-handgif/index_1662929950.html alt=\"Steel Realms Map\" lazyload \/><\/a><\/div><div class=\"modal fade\" id=\"basicModal\" tabindex=\"-1\" role=\"dialog\" aria-labelledby=\"basicModal\" aria-hidden=\"true\">\r\n    <div class=\"modal-dialog\">\r\n        <div class=\"modal-content\">\r\n            <div class=\"modal-header\">\r\n            <button type=\"button\" class=\"close\" data-dismiss=\"modal\" aria-hidden=\"true\">X<\/button>\r\n            <h4 class=\"modal-title\" id=\"myModalLabel\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Modal_title\"><\/span>Modal title<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\r\n            <\/div>\r\n            <div class=\"modal-body\" id=\"myModalPop\">\r\n            <\/div>\r\n    <\/div>\r\n  <\/div>\r\n<\/div><script>jQuery(\"a[class^='dndclass-cleric'],a[class*=' dndclass-cleric']\").prop(\"href\",\"\/characters\/class\/cleric\");jQuery(\"a[class^='dndclass-fighter'],a[class*=' dndclass-fighter']\").prop(\"href\",\"\/characters\/class\/fighter\");jQuery(\"a[class^='dndclass-ranger'],a[class*=' dndclass-ranger']\").prop(\"href\",\"\/characters\/class\/ranger\");jQuery(\"a[class^='dndclass-barbarian'],a[class*=' dndclass-barbarian']\").prop(\"href\",\"\/characters\/class\/barbarian\");jQuery(\"a[class^='dndclass-druid'],a[class*=' dndclass-druid']\").prop(\"href\",\"\/characters\/class\/druid\");<\/script>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This order of the Lady of Light, Aerna, is an order that practices non lethal combat in order to defend the pacifists of the clergy of Aerna.
