Anuator was a man of exceeding goodness and charity. He was a devotee of some powerful Celestial being, and it is said that this being crafted the shield for him to defeat evil creatures. By all accounts, he seemed totally fearless in pursuing such targets &#8211; nothing could dissuade him from his task. It was said that the shield was really made for he AND his best friend Torren&#8230; Torren would use his friends shield to amplify his power when on quests, to protect them from those seeking to track them or stop them. On the battlefield, Anuator had a reputation for &#8220;being everywhere&#8221;; A lot of it was due to this feature of his shield &#8211; causing his dancing sword to fly far away and be attacking, in addition to him attacking himself with his mighty halberd.<br \/>\nDESCRIPTION: The shield is rectangular, not round. It is decorated, but not ostentatiously. It appears to be wood backed and with a polished steel rim and covering, with elements of gold, copper, and silver decoration. Grime and wear always seem to vanish and it is restored to its pristine look each morning. <\/p>\n<p><b>Armor Properties<\/b>: +2 AC bonus (medium, heavy; 2 measures of Greater resilience &#8211; no impact on AC)<br \/>\nBonus Action to animate [for 10 minutes at a time].
