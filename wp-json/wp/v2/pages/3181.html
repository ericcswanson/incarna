I have had unpleasant experiences with nearly every hosting solutions I have dealt with &#8211; hidden fees, no access to backups, poor turnaround on support, exposure to malware\/hacks, etc. &#8211; i want no surprises, and good access to support. Over the years we went from server side logic (ASP) to flat html with Ajax. Control is nice, but i want to focus on content and not coding and technology &#8211; a platform i can get some of the old functionality back without having to write a bunch of code is a great idea.\n<\/p>\n<p>https:\/\/wordpress.org\/support\/topic\/bluehost-2<\/p>\n<p>WPEngine looks to be the best. Its about $30\/month &#8211; but there&#8217;s NOTHING hidden in that. They seem to guarantee nearly every aspect of their service and have an AMAZING stable to companies using their hosted solutions which include a staging version to test upgrades, etc.. They have great information on their site, no broken links or dead ends that i could find (unlike Bluehost, Hostgator, and others) &#8211; seems to be the best out there at what they do.\n<\/p>\n<div>ServerPress:<br \/>\n<br \/>Payment: \t\t\t40833 \t\t \t\t\t \t \t\t \tPayment<br \/>\n<br \/>Status: \t\t\tComplete \t\t \t\t \t\t\tPayment Method: \t\t\t\tFree Purchase \t\t\t \t\tDate: \t\t\tMay 17, 2015 \t\t \t\t \t\t \t\t \t<br \/>Subtotal \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t$0.00\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t<br \/>Total Price: \t\t\t\t$0.00 \t\t\t License Keys:DesktopServer Limited\n<\/div>\n<p>Logo: http:\/\/cooltext.com\/<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>06\/205 CURRENT STATE: Currently flat content HTML 5\/Jquery Mobile based site using only javascript\/Ajax, and SSI and a single content editor NEW STATE Proposal: In order to scale, we need to move to a real CMS system.
