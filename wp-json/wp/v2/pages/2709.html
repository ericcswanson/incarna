It raises you up, pulling you from the mists of dream that obscure all round you. Above it now, supported by your patron, you see stages, stages wherein agents like yourself and agents of your patron\u2019s foes act out play after play, a violent drama in many cases. The one below you is sabotaged, the agent before you having never had a chance to act, and the curtain comes down and the patrons of the play cannot escape. Choking on the poisonous fumes of dream, they die slowly and horribly. But from above, you see what happens and find a point in the drama which you could insert yourself, and possibly change the outcome. As the hymns begin all around you, you are surrounded by doors, and door after door you choose to go through, getting closer and closer to the stage below you. Finally, the last door leads to the clouded stage &#8211; you have proven your intent and as an agent of your faith prepare to do battle with the machinations of your patron\u2019s enemy. <\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Occult_Hook\"><\/span>Occult Hook<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p class=\"panel panel-default know\">The vibrations of the pattern are broken. You hear the woven strands of lives that are cut short, like a thousand guitar strings sliced in two thousands of times. A great disruption has taken place here, and the weave re-written in a way that poisons a million other lives down its course. This toxin will seeth and grow in ways terrible and inimical to your own life strand and those around you. Yet here you float, colors rippling around you, endless strands tangled and broken, tieing and un tieing and a chance to reach out and secure the source, which will in turn vitalize yourself. You close your eyes and plunge into the tangled web above you, reaching out to grab hold of the dark ends of the weave that threaten your pattern. <\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Psychic_Hook\"><\/span>Psychic Hook<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p class=\"panel panel-default know\">The deep bindings in you twist. Your patron\u2019s enemy is near, and the wind carries the sound of their breathing. Louder and louder, you hear it behind you, and feel it hot on the back of your neck. Your patron has lost a challenge, but beneath you, as you commune swirls the clouds of a vast dreamscape. You are lowered gently into this, and the world changes around you. What was written may be unwritten &#8211; your patron has found a way to possibly change a defeat into a victory through you, their agent. You submit yourself to their power and are swallowed by the cyclone of dreams. <\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Nature_Hook\"><\/span>Nature Hook<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p class=\"panel panel-default know\">The balance has been greatly disturbed. Something that should never have been allowed to happen, has happened. There is a greater hand in this, one you cannot see, but the very ground moans in anguish, and the wind brings voices crying in the thousands for justice. You can smell the rich earth, soaked with their blood. The tears you shed for the innocent become a river, a river that roars above their cries, and that carries you over a cliff and down a falls into a misty world of dreams, where you float and drift, carried by the currents of nature to the place you know you need to be.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Kinetic_Hook\"><\/span>Kinetic Hook<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<\/p>\n<h1><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Scenarios_for_The_Merchant_of_Fate\"><\/span>Scenarios for The Merchant of Fate<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h1>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Character_Death\"><\/span>Character Death<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Characters cannot die&#8230;<\/p>\n<p class=\"panel panel-default\">Suddenly your heart stops.

You also realize the pain has gone and all is silent\u2026 and a shadow from behind you casts you in cold darkness. Death has finally found you. You turn as a skeletal hand rest on your shoulder.
