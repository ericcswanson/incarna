Poles dominated by frost and blowing ice, rare snowstorms. One surface sea with high salt content accounts for 10% of planet surface. Other water locked in subterranean aquifers. Upper planetary crust is rich with minerals, precious metals, and fossil fuels.\n<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Flora_and_Fauna\"><\/span>Flora and Fauna<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Dominated by species which can survive long periods without sustenance through hibernation or some other means of slowed metabolism. Animal species largely reptilian or those which prey on reptiles. Most plant species have highly adapted defense mechanisms, are very slow growing and produce seeds which can lie dormant for hundreds or even thousands of years.\n<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Industry\"><\/span>Industry<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Several corporations have mining operations spread across the planet\u037e most use guarded compounds for employees, often with luxurious manager residences. Several agribusiness companies also have farming and water mining operations to keep the population supplied with food. Most mining operations also have refinement facilities for processing products before shipment off\u00adplanet. Starlaw and UPF units pay a nominal fee to the planetary government in order to use the uninhabited regions of the planet for desert training exercises. The possibility of selling a mineral rich claim to a corporation has drawn many would\u00adbe prospectors to Ishak IV\u037e the unforgiving environment has broken many of them. The presence of corporate militias and the general lack of law enforcement has combined to create a thriving illegal weapons trade.\n<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Politics\"><\/span>Politics<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>A planetary parliament of elected members ostensibly rules, but are known to be puppets of those corporations present on Ishak IV. The only laws passed by the parliament are those not at odds with corporate interests. The planetside police force is known to be corrupt even by rimworld standards\u037e overrun by graft, nepotism, bribery and protection schemes. As huge areas are held under mining claims, they fall under the jurisdiction of the corporate militias.\n<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Transportation\"><\/span>Transportation<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Due to the long distances involved, most transport of personnel is via low\u00adatmospheric air transport, while heavy mineral and foodstuff shipments are made by hovertrain. A system of linkways connects most cities and outposts. These are trenches dug by specialized machines which then pack and chemically harden the soil surface into a smooth trainway useable by hover and ground craft. The linkways run in pairs, one \u201cinbound\u201d and one \u201coutbound\u201d, with<br \/>\nperipheral roads for smaller vehicles.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Major_cities\"><\/span>Major cities<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Sulfur: pop. 3 million, the largest city on Ishak IV and home to its only major spaceport. Sulfur is a hub of transport systems, and is home to no less than 50 refinement facilities. Second tier industries include supplies sales (food, equipment, fuel, etc.), gambling, prostitution, illegal drugs and security services.\n<\/p>\n<p>Potash: pop. 1 million, Ishak\u2019s second largest city, a smaller version of sulfur. Chromium: pop. 700,000\u037e A resort city on the Turquoise Sea, its high end facilities cater to corporate executives living on Ishak IV and include imported palm trees, sand beaches, and swimming areas with high tech security systems to keep out the numerous hungry and dangerous inhabitants of the sea. Its low end resorts cater to those miners who can afford to get there and stay. The balance of the population is spread throughout smaller communities and mining facilities around the planet.\n<\/p>\n<p><b>Addendum 1<\/b>: UPF Explorer Corps, Analytical Services Department Subjective Review and Recommendation Ishak IV is a lawless corporate puppet planet, currently suffering the worst types of exploitation. There is little or no regard for indigenous life forms, nor for the welfare of its colonials. Most of the city dwelling population live in cheaply built, substandard apartment blocks\u037e while corporate employees dwell in pre\u00adfab dormitories. Due to poor planetary defense systems and lax local law enforcement, pirates and smugglers frequent the uninhabited regions of the planet to evade and capture.\n<\/p>\n<p>The ecosystem is failing under pollution and overuse\u037e and at the current rate of growth, we estimate the planet could be rendered uninhabitable in under 2 centuries. We recommend immediate annexation by UPF forces, with implementation of Federation laws. We estimate that an augmented regiment sized force could secure the major cities and transport sites and begin law enforcement details until a Starlaw outpost could be established. Addendum 2: United Planetary Federation Charter on Sentient Rights, Office of the Commissioner, Current Review and RecommendationA downturn in mining has led to mass unemployment. In less than twenty years the mostly automated mining operations have stripped out 94% of easily accessible minerals. Exploitation of un\u00ad and under\u00ademployed masses is the worst of any UPF planet. Ishak IV has become a virtual \u2018failed state world\u2019, making it a haven for crime, terrorism, fugitives, etc. The planet has become a haven for smugglers (weapons, controlled substances, technology, information, sentient trafficking). Wealthy criminals occupy lavish compounds\u037e the poor relegated to shanties, substandard housing blocks, squatting in abandoned corporate dormitories, and the like.\n<\/p>\n<p>Freelance prospecting for small mineral deposits is still thriving, but plagued by parasitic gangs. The government did finally stop corporations from simply staking claims over entire planet\u037e detailed resource mapping to stake a claim about a decade ago, but the damage was mostly done. After rumors of archeological sites started circulating there is now an emergent \u2018treasure hunting\u2019 industry. There\u2019s been little substantiated success, but rumors fuel rushes to new sites, with accompanying violence. E.g., a cave is discovered, the first arriving explorer tries to claim or explore it, others arrive, violence ensues. Given the high rates of violence, crime, exploitation, etc. the UPF has decided to take a more active role in the future of Ishak IV. The commissioner\u2019s office recommends sending an advance investigative team to Ishak 4 with the mandate to \u201cDocument the scope of: sentient exploitation, smuggling, corruption, and various criminal enterprises. Identify the 5 largest offenders in each category: Corporate, government, and private. Identify most immediate needs of the populace.\u201d Due to the current security situation planetside, any necessary defense measures for the team are authorized.\n<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Hovertrain_details\"><\/span>Hovertrain details<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>The hovertrains run in a sort of sunken roadway called a \u201clinkway\u201d. These have vertical sides and a flat bottom, and are 10 meters wide to accommodate the largest trains. There is a ladder sunk into the side walls of the trench every half kilometer for entrance\/egress. This system can only be effective in locales with very little rainfall, as drainage of the trenches is a problem (although the hovertrains will displace a moderate amount of water as they pass). Terminals have side\u00adtracks where the trains pull off of the main line to stop, with large mobile curbs to help direct the trains. The trains themselves are up to 150 meters long and 10 meters wide. There is a \u201ctractor\u201d vehicle at each end with a micro\u00adfusion plant which supplies power to the hover fans in all cars. Between the tractors are connected a collection of various types of cargo cars, with an articulating joint between each. There are box cars, hopper cars (common for mining operations), special purpose cars and even passenger cars. Many of the cargo cars have a built\u00adin crane to facilitate loading and unloading. The plenum chamber is surrounded by a soft skirt, surmounted by a hard\u00adshell skirt beneath the cars and tractors. When the chamber is not pressurized, the train sits on the hard skirt, at which point access hatches allow personnel into the chamber for servicing. There is a small, wheeled \u201ccreeper\u201d cart (1.5 by 2.5 meters) in eachtractor car which allows service personnel to move around easily beneath the train. Every car and tractor also has horizontally mounted wheels on the sides so that they can rub the sides of the trenches without damage, as the built in guidance systems are quite limited at high speeds. Smaller hover vehicles mount these wheels on booms to reach the sides of the trenches. The trains reach speeds of up to 300 km\/h, depending on load, grade, weather conditions, etc. They have a long acceleration\/deceleration phase into and out of terminals. They normally carry a rew of two for cargo transport, one in each tractor. The linkways themselves have a service road on each side and one between the trenches\u037e it is a simple, unsealed dirt road.\n<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Planetside_Security_Notes\"><\/span>Planetside Security Notes<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Due to frequent seismic and volcanic activity, motion\/vibration sensing equipment is of little use on Ishak IV. The barren, uniform terrain makes infrared and short range radar systems ideal here, although occasional broken terrain and canyons, etc. inhibit their use. As the native life forms on Ishak IV have highly developed pheromonal systems, almost every defense system employs \u201csniffer\u201d devices which can identify most threats by their olfactory components.\n<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Places\"><\/span>Places<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n<hr \/>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"GM_Notes\/References\"><\/span>GM Notes\/References<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Views of Ishak 4 that, in a more organized world, we could have projected for a backdrop:<br \/>\nRocky plains around Sulfur: http:\/\/news.povray.org\/povray.binaries.images\/attachment\/%3C4ca62784%40news.povray.org%3E\/rocky-desert-05.jpg<br \/>\nSulfur industrial area by night: http:\/\/www.businesskorea.co.kr\/sites\/default\/files\/field\/image\/oil%20refinery.jpg<br \/>\nFlying in to the medical clinic in Sulfur: https:\/\/s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com\/originals\/2a\/09\/b8\/2a09b85af98316361b5512d4323270bb.jpg<br \/>\nThe turquoise sea: https:\/\/www.deadseamoringa.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/shutterstock_424376872.jpg<br \/>\nChromium is pretty much just like: http:\/\/caelle.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/Dubaj.jpg<br \/>\nTypical sandy desert: https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/3\/34\/Rub_al_Khali_002.JPG<br \/>\nHighland\/mountainous regions: https:\/\/www.blacktomato.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/Mountain-view.jpg<br \/>\nApproach to the crater and bomb factory: https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/madesco\/12250731426<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<div>GM Notes 7\/2017<\/div>\n<p>It would be fun to keep playing some SF, I think.
