He has a scar on his head from a very clear head wound. He remembers little of his childhood &#8211; just glimpses and hazy images. He remembers joining up with the Black Hounds. He remembers a little of the fight in which he was wounded &#8211; but he remembers little of his &#8220;friends&#8221; he met in the Black Hounds and the history of it he was taught. In fact, he really only remembers waking up in the field hospital and after. He has had those who can read, read from the chronicles of the Black Hounds that he was hired as a troubleshooter &#8211; someone who knew small places, traps, and could protect a camp site and navigate through narrow streets and tunnel traps, locks, and roof tops. <\/p>\n<p>When offered a chance to join The Gallants, he jumped &#8211; it was a new and more secure future than what he faced with no memories. He does hear the voice of Mistessa whispering to him (something he remembers for a long time now), urging him in that direction. He knows that the voice of her caused the distraction which lead to his head wound being a wound and not a death blow &#8211; so he owes his life to this strange patron. She promises him knowledge in exchange for sharing his life experiences. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Class: Rogue 2nd (Arcane Trickster @ 3rd; Patron is &#8220;Mistessa&#8221;) Hit Dice: 6, 6 Essence: 18+2 = 20 \/2 = 10 Strength: 12 {+1} Intelligence: 10 Wisdom: 13 {+1} Dexterity: 17 {+3} Constitution: 18 [20] {+4} Charisma: 14 {+2} Sanity: 9 {-1} Proficiency @+2 Skills: Insight (Wisdom), Persuasion (Charisma), Acrobatics (Dexterity), Athletics (Strength), Perception (Wisdom; [&hellip;]<\/p>\n<a role=\"link\" class=\"rtp-readmore\" title=\"Read more on Tellip Wellworth\" href=../../../../22http/incarnanet/host/steven-grenier/chars/bailyn-dulak/tellip-wellworth/22_1275467594.html rel=\"nofollow\">Read More \u2192<\/a>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"parent":5493,"menu_order":18,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":[],"categories":[],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/5495"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=5495"}],"version-history":[{"count":10,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/5495\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":6042,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/5495\/revisions\/6042"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/5493"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=5495"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=5495"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=5495"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
