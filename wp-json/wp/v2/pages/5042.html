Under-nourished and small, she was perfect for an acrobatics act. She was purposefully starved and kept small as she grow older. She developed a closer bond with the animals of the circus &#8211; who were also starved and beaten. An unnatural love grew between her and her horse, as they both grew up together. Along with it, she learned to live vicariously by pushing the limits of her acrobatics, and soon became dependent on crazed stunts to feel alive. They began to include more weapons, more pageantry, more risk. When the bard saw the circus act rescued from an abusive circus by the bard. The bard was harsh upon the circus, and freed several of the animals and indicted them for cruelty. Some of the circus owners planned to kill the person who had torn them apart &#8211; They escaped with the fighters real love &#8211; the white horse that was their partner in the acrobatic performance. They owe the bard their lives and service and travel with the bard for now until the debt can be repaid. <\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"A_Problem_with_the_Living\"><\/span>A Problem with the Living<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><a href=../../../../22/host/larry-james/chars/gabrella/22_1309548065.html>Gabrella<\/a>, <a href=../../../../22/host/marc-chapman/chars/emily/22_192049779.html>Emily<\/a>, <a href=../../../../22/edward-berg/chars/dairn/22_223760430.html>Dairn<\/a>, <a href=../../../../22/host/kelly-royal/chars/justav/22_1132362303.html>Justav<\/a>, <a href=../../../../22/host/tara-flannery/chars/toulath-silverhair/22_875904257.html>Toulath<\/a>, and <a href=../../../../22/host/steven-grenier/chars/gaardu/22_102517828.html>Gaardu<\/a> have joined forces to track down and evil renegade of the Narcosa Necromancer Guild and stop hm before he can do something horrible. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Fighter 1st Description: Size [Medium], Movement &#8211; Normal (30\u2019); 4\u201911\u201d, half-elven female; #121, silvery hair with golden streaks, freckles, green eyes with golden flecks, right handed, age 17 Alignment\/Code\/Mannerisms: Chaotic Good > Intolerance: Animal Abuse (Sanity check) Background: Entertainer (Tumbler &#038; Dancer) &#8211; Personality Trait: I\u2019m a hopeless romantic, always searching for that \u201cspecial someone\u201d [&hellip;]<\/p>\n<a role=\"link\" class=\"rtp-readmore\" title=\"Read more on Toulath Silverhair\" href=../../../../22http/incarnanet/host/tara-flannery/chars/toulath-silverhair/22_591344183.html rel=\"nofollow\">Read More \u2192<\/a>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"parent":5029,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":[],"categories":[],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/5042"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=5042"}],"version-history":[{"count":2,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/5042\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":5070,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/5042\/revisions\/5070"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/5029"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=5042"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=5042"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=5042"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
