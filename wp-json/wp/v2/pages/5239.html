Teppo, one of Spider many lieutenants, tells you that Spider gave to her an old book about a temple to a strange god &#8211; long ago abandoned and buried, in the hills 2 days west of their current location.

The bones of several creatures and their remains. There is a serviceable suit of chainmail, but the other armors are falling apart. There is a long sword, short sword, and a scimitar (5E DMG p19-20) which have been imbued with an evil animation from the gibbering mouther. One can enter the foray each round after the mouther starts gibbering. Unless a character has a passive Perception of 14 or more, they get surprise on their first attack.\n<\/p>\n<p><b>Room #3 Changes<\/b>:\n<\/p>\n<p><b>Room #4 &#8211; 6 Changes<\/b>: NONE, except HollowBone will use these effects as weapons bagainst a pursuing party\n<\/p>\n<p><b>Room #7 Changes<\/b>: <b>Up ahead, strange whispers echo down the corridor.<\/b> The 2 creatures use the runes carved on the wall to amplify their evil whispers.

The party can then ask the Ki-Rin any question and they will try and answer. If HollowBone drops below half his HP, he loses his teachings and invokes his old master &#8211; giving up his path towards good once and for all. An Imp is sent to hail his return and assist in the fight. HollowBone gets a DC 13 Constitution check when invoking his old master to call down the effects of a Shatter Spell on the largest group of PC&#8217;s. If the PC&#8217;s have ignored or bypassed #8 and #9, these are allies he can break the chains of. He will attempt to disengage and fly to them, breaking their chains. If this happens, on the 3rd round after the first one freed, the Ki-Rin (Volo&#8217;s Guide) will appear and put down the evil creatures. They will tell Hollowbone how disappointed they ware, and how his death hurts them more than it does him. They will then turn their attention to the party and chastise them for what they have done.

In fact, a few unidentified individuals have come seeking his whereabouts form you&#8230; and you even had one group almost attack you.

You should have made plans, but it simply slipped your mind. Instead of your typical well-off lodgings, you find yourself at The Leaning Weasel. More of a taven than an Inn, its cheap, the beds are mostly clean, and the servants dont bite. Its a place where mercenaries are hired, and back room deals are made. Not your typical clientele or company. Sullen, you stake out one of the corners for the evening, waiting to see what entertainment will be found tonight, and waiting on the generously named stew and bread. At least the butter is good. Following the waitress is another woman, dressed in clean versions of peasants clothes. Your meal is served&#8230; under cooked again. You wait expectantly for the clean dressed woman to speak. She nervously looks around, perhaps thinking you will make the first move and after a couple awkward minutes she says her name is Anameth. She has asked for a rough group like yourselves for a job of finding a friend of hers who has gone missing. Itheena, the waitress recommended you, because she said &#8220;no one here is up to the task, sober. Theres some new group though &#8211; maybe they are not incompetent.&#8221; And so i fond myself here, beseeching you to aid me in finding my best friend Marin.

Anameth is the elder sibling of a family which practices the old ways of matrileneal preference in inheritance. Anameth once trusted her brother, and now believes the worst of him &#8211; rightfully so.

Worth 200xp per session <i>currently<\/i>.<br \/>\nTrack Items: You should track limited use items (arrows, etc.) and you may be expected to make repair or replace armor, shield, etc. from normal use.<br \/>\nGM Readiness: Adventures will be complete and smooth flowing. I don&#8217;t use digital tools, but i do use miniatures. If someone wants to run fantasy grounds for the sessions, thats fine. If theres a glitch, we dont stop, we fall back to verbal descriptions.<br \/>\nRewards: There is patronage in-adventure, hence you will not need to &#8220;kill people and take shit&#8221;. There is not as much treasure and coin, there will be more XP than normal.<br \/>\nChoose Preferences: (Y\/N)<br \/>\n1) Lethality: Critical automatically do maximum damage plus another dice; on spells with individual target it does half the dice or fist dice maximum damage.<br \/>\n&#8211; Choose as a group<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Equipment_Supplement\"><\/span>Equipment Supplement<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<h4><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Mothers_Tears\"><\/span>Mothers Tears<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n<p>This necklace has 3 large and 7 small sparkling crystals (scintillate with blue, green and clear) that appear fragile yet are hard as steel. The crystal shards work as a unit &#8211; if one breaks, the entire necklace is useless. When the wearer takes them off, they can sing at a certain frequency, pitch and tone to enact their magic. The crystals vibrate when they are working. Each effect can only be done 1\/long rest.<br \/>\n> All functions are at the minimum level to enact for the spell, unless the wearer is a bard and their bard spell level is higher &#8211; it then uses that level. A bard is considered 2 levels higher for their song of rest. The singing to enact is done as an Action and takes 1 round to work.<br \/>\n1) The necklace is placed on the chest of the target and the wearer sings: The target is affected as if by a Lesser Restoration and Feign Death if so desired. <\/p>\n<p>2) The necklace is placed on the head of the target and the wearer sings: The target continues to hear the song in their head for the next hour &#8211; during which time they are resistant to psychic damage, immune to Charmed and Frightened and it negates 1 level of Exhaustion during that time. <\/p>\n<p>3) The necklace is held above the wearer and the wearer sings: combines the Light cantrip and Healing Word; if cast at second level or higher then each D4 may be placed on different targets. <\/p>\n<p>Requires Attunement; it takes a bonus action to take the necklace off or on. The wearer must sing for an hour 1\/short rest and at least 3 times per long rest  to re-energize the necklace. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This is an adventure summary.
