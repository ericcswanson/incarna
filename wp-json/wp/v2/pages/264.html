Most common folk will see them as the source of trouble and potential concern. Items of power, adventure, perilous travel, and violent encounters of the kind of thing most adventurers seek out are something commoners wish to avoid. In some places, PC&#8217;s are overcharged, under-served, and even &#8220;ushered&#8221; out of town by angry citizens hoping to prevent the delicate local balance of power from being upset. Some PC&#8217;s may have a <b>Patron<\/b> (a Lady or Lord, or Institution; see Factions of Power) which give them authority and respect to avoid such local animosity. <\/p>\n<p><b>Gender Roles of the Civilized Lands<\/b>: Females are generally seen as a weaker class of people among most races. In general, they are physically less strong than the normal male, and in places where survival is a daily concern it relegates them to a lower status. Males hold most of the dominant positions of power, and in general the cultures are patriarchal in modern times (less so in the past). Key exceptions to this are some Pine Tribes clans, Skraelings, Ducateon society (caste, not gender is the main factor), Wyld Aelf clans, the Duchy of Dunstrand and the Duchy of Aelmir (wherein lies Oerdney &#8211; the seat of the High King); females are treated as equals in almost all ways &#8211; legal standing, property, marriage, and business. The binary of female and male conform to definitions brought on by appearance and sexual characteristics. &#8220;Krasals&#8221; are a form of hermaphrodite that is common (2% of humans) in the southern heartlands and are typically androgynous in appearance; they are accepted there and in the central heartlands without issue. The Pine Tribes accept without issue the &#8220;Wind Wending&#8221; &#8211; those among them with fluid gender (homosexuals, hermaphrodite, cross dressers and others) both in appearance and sexual characteristics. Those of the Wyld Faith are much more accepting of gender fluidity than either the regimented Light Bringers or Unholy Trio of Darkness.\n<\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<div id=\"char-know1\" class=\"tab-pane fade\">\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Key_Historical_Events\"><\/span><i class=\"fa fa-calendar\"><\/i> Key Historical Events<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<div><a href=../../../../22/verse/set/steel-realms/campaign/22_323881776.html>Full Campaign Reference<\/a>&#8230;<em>It is STRONGLY recommended that new players in the Steel Realms Campaign read through the full history of the World to be familiar and comfortable playing in the world from the start.<\/em><\/div>\n<ul class=\"campaign-date\">\n<li>Item &#8211; Date<\/li>\n<li>The Sundering &#8211; 5000 CY (Common Year): Fall of the southern lands and Sea King empire.

While the realms rely on peerage for ruling hierarchy, the heartlands are also governed by &#8220;Hindsmuth&#8221; (old word for &#8220;Common Law&#8221;); the heartlands in particular have a court system in the major town and cities, with magistrates and law officers. Peerage titles offer the ability to call for a retrial with a new judge, or to declare a mistrial in the event of a travesty of justice. In rural and country places, Bards are often sought to pass judgement using their knowledge of the law and insight. Outside the heartlands, sheriffs enforce titled nobles direct wills. <i>Many PC&#8217;s must follow a code of conduct or set of laws or tenets dictated by their <b>Patron<\/b> (see Factions of Power).<\/i><\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<div id=\"char-know3\" class=\"tab-pane fade\">\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Factions_of_Power\"><\/span><i class=\"fa fa-bolt\"><\/i> Factions of Power<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>PC&#8217;s may not be familiar with <a href=../../../../22/index_791818789.html>all of the factions<\/a>, but some are known across the entire breadth of the realms well, while others are known only to those of related class or backgrounds.<\/p>\n<h4><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Patronage\"><\/span>Patronage<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n<p>Most PC&#8217;s must find the protection and enter into the service of a <b>Patron<\/b>.
