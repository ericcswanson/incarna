Some believe she is an ally of the fallen Sea Kings. Others believe she was a creation of the Bronzemen. Many theories abound, but little is known of the enigmatic figure which is bound to the territories of Dunstrand. Her reach extends no further, but as the self appointed guardian of Dwindor, she is a demigod in power. The creatures of the swamp are her senses. It is said she wanders the roads sometimes, an old crone with a crow. She has come to the aid of Dunstrand several times in its history, but also has she attacked, harassed, and slaughtered its inhabitants. She keep council with none and her motivations are hidden in the mists of the swamp. The Orrish of Dwindor Swamp consider her a goddess, and venerate her directly. Her power seems absolute in Dunstrand Vale, she and her servants draw strength from the very air, water, and land. Her supposed wickedness is legendary&#8230; the portrait she paints is one of evil and selfishness. <\/p>\n<p><b>Peoples Reaction to Her Agents<\/b>: The people will be fearful of her presence\/symbol.

Her will is the light that guides the hidden powers that move, make, and destroy the fortunes of the ancient vale of Dunstrand. Every creature in the vale is her eyes, ears, nose and mouth; what they perceive she may perceive. I too am an extension of her senses and agent of her will in all things. She is the shadowy mother of intrigue, the iron maiden of war, and the withered crone of disaster. She is the vengeance that flows down from the peaks, rivers, and clouds over those that would bring down her spirit and drench the vale in the blood of strife. I deliver wrath upon those she decrees. So to do i operate to ensure those she deems worthy flourish in her machinations. While i am within the vale, she is the ultimate power I look to, the answers to what I seek lies within her vision and so i align my efforts and goals to elevate her and the power of the vale. <\/p>\n<h3>Oath of Service<\/h3>\n<p>The oath that those who serve her now is much abbreviated. It is simple, and goes thusly:<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;While in Dwindor, I bow to her wishes in everything &#8211; though they be in opposition to mine. The Witch of Dwindor sees more than I and I, as her agent, will fulfill her requests with all the powers of my disposal.&#8221; <\/p>\n<div class=\"know-more\">You recite the oath, and willingly open yourself to her power. You feel a protective shroud come down over you. You know that the Witch has protected you ever so slightly from outside forces of magic while in the vale. You also feel an itch in your gut. At first it is a gnawing sensation but quickly fades. Something has been planted in you that will take hold if you cross her. <\/div>\n<ul class=\"nav nav-tabs\">\n<li class=\"active\"><a data-toggle=\"tab\" href=../../../../22_842147072.html><img src=../../../../22/wp-content/uploads/d20png/index_105716085.html style=\"width:14px\"> D20<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a data-toggle=\"tab\" href=../../../../22_842147072.html><img src=../../../../22/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/favicongif/index_1832861513.html alt=\"ICore\" style=\"width:14px\">ICore<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div class=\"tab-content\">\n<div id=\"d20\" class=\"tab-pane fade in active\">\n<h3>D20 Adherent of the Dwindor Witch<\/h3>\n<p>The character commits themselves to the a power base of the Vale of Dunstrand and the interests of the Witch of Dwindor.
