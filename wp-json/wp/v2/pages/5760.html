Unlike most, he has a sense of humor about just about everything and is willing to laugh out loud (which is really unnerving for those not familiar with the Grollen), even at himself. He likes to play simple, practical jokes and loves to let children crawl all over him and tickle them. Of course, no one lets their kids within 10 miles if they can help it. Its theorized that the blow to the head he took in the Montaurn Campaign when he first joined somehow altered him. Like all of his kind, he howls and dances\u2026 and the full moon is his favorite time to do it.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>CLASS: BARBARIAN (2nd; Undecided path) Hit Points: 12, 7 +8 = 27 Strength 17 { +3 } Intelligence 9 { -1 } Wisdom 8 { -1 } Dexterity 14 { +2 } Constitution 19 { +4 } Charisma 11 {} Sanity 12 { +1 } Proficiency @+2 Bonus Saves: Strength, Constitution Armor: Light, Medium, Shields [&hellip;]<\/p>\n<a role=\"link\" class=\"rtp-readmore\" title=\"Read more on Durrgo &#8220;the Laughing One&#8221;\" href=../../../../22http/incarnanet/host/larry-james/chars/durrgo-laughing/22_1380785771.html rel=\"nofollow\">Read More \u2192<\/a>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"parent":371,"menu_order":35,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":[],"categories":[],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/5760"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=5760"}],"version-history":[{"count":4,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/5760\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":5789,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/5760\/revisions\/5789"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/371"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=5760"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=5760"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=5760"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
