His commision as a captain got him in, but it was soon clear he was a natural tactician and sailor. He chafed under the strict regimen of his countrymen, for him the war with imperial Gwinn was a godsend. He sold his commision in the navy, and bought himself a swift ship. Before his family\u2019s honor was decreased by his actions, he used their name to get loans to outfit the ship. His previous connections got him a privateer contract on the Queen&#8217;s Coast of Umbak (north). For three years he terrorized the Gwinnish shipping. It was not the Gwinnish that finally brought him low, it was his own hubris. He chose to use a storm as cover for his hunting, got caught up in it, and lost his ship. His name was ruined. He paid his debts from his gains, and fell into a bottle of cheap wine. He\u2019s been looking for a way to redeem himself in his own eyes. <\/p>\n<p>=================<br \/>\nBilly Claye &#8211; Teamster; Spencer is now playing<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Blackwell Squad Baggage Train Treasury Group Inspiration\/ Blessings\/ Gifts False Life cast upon the group at the end of every short rest (Green Church prayer). +1 healing factor and advantage on co while within the barony of crestwold (Swamp witch boon from slaying Orks). 1 holy word of Gaia (Cast on behalf of the entire [&hellip;]<\/p>\n<a role=\"link\" class=\"rtp-readmore\" title=\"Read more on Blackwell Squad Baggage Train\" href=../../../../22http/incarnanet/verse/set/steel-realms/campaign/records/dunstrand-rising-story/tarmysian-tests/blackwell-baggage-train/22_306185530.html rel=\"nofollow\">Read More \u2192<\/a>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"parent":5508,"menu_order":22,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":[],"categories":[],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/5769"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=5769"}],"version-history":[{"count":22,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/5769\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":7958,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/5769\/revisions\/7958"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/5508"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=5769"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=5769"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=5769"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
