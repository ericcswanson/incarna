Among the adept are those who are truly gifted, having an almost preternatural talent for anticipating the behavior of their targeted mark. Being among their ranks, you have an uncanny ability to recall specific details of conversation and names you overhear or participate in as it relates to your bounty, or otherwise see written, even if only for a moment or two. You can also sketch out faces and general locations you've seen with accuracy, possessing exceptional recollection. In addition, you often effortlessly identify clues when tracking your bounty's movements and disposition that would be otherwise lost on lesser pursuers.\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div id=\"char-cap2\" class=\"tab-pane fade\"><div><i class=\"fa fa-shield\"><\/i><a href=../../../../22/items/armor/22_762717010.html> <b>Armor<\/b><\/a>: Light Armor, Medium Armor\n<\/div>\r\n<div><i class=\"fa fa-crosshairs\"><\/i><a href=../../../../22/items/weapon/22_2071805041.html> <b>Weapons<\/b><\/a>: Simple Weapons, Martial Weapons, Improvised\n<\/div>\r\n<div><b>Tools<\/b>: Thieves Tools\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Traits\"><\/span>Traits<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\r\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Feats\"><\/span>Feats<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\r\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Powers\"><\/span>Powers<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2><b>Relentless Endurance<\/b>: When reduced to 0 Health, instead reduced to only 1 - use this 1\/Long Rest.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Equipment\"><\/span>Equipment<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\r\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Armor\"><\/span><i class=\"fa fa-shield\"><\/i> Armor<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\r\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Weapons\"><\/span><i class=\"fa fa-crosshairs\"><\/i> Weapons<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\r\n<b><i class=\"fa fa-magic\"><\/i> Arcane Focus<\/b>: \n\r\n<div>Full Listing > \n<\/div>\r\n<ul class=\"nav nav-tabs\">\r\n<li class=\"active\"><a data-toggle=\"tab\" href=../../../../22_842147072.html>Physical Characteristics<\/a><\/li>\r\n  <li><a data-toggle=\"tab\" href=../../../../22_842147072.html>Behavioral Characteristics<\/a><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<div class=\"tab-content\">\r\n<div id=\"char-charis0\" class=\"tab-pane fade in active\" style=\"background-color:#DCDCF5\"><h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Physical_Features,_Form,_and_Appearance\"><\/span>Physical Features, Form, and Appearance<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\r\n<b>Race<\/b>: Half Orc\n\r\n<b>Size<\/b>: Medium\n | <b>Movement<\/b>: 30'\n > \r\n<b>Beauty<\/b>: Ugly\n<div><b>Description<\/b>: 5'6\", 149#, brown hair (short) and mustache, brown eyes, right handed, brown skin (Nakrian origins - his palms and soles are greenish like an ork); he has black nails (like an ork, but claims he paints them for effect).

It turns out she was pregnant. She was kicked into the slums by her ex-owner and managed to steal enough to live on for a year. Then she turned to prostitution. As a Nakrian she was exotic, but not enough - no pimp would take her and she was beaten and lived in poverty - dying alone of starvation. Seeing a lone sneak-thief make off with a drug-runners money and get killed, and many other times where people tried to go it alone, he realized he needed friends. Friends lead to allies, allies to partners in crime, and crime to a taste of something better.\n<\/div>\r\n  <div id=\"char-story2\" class=\"tab-pane fade\">\r\n    <h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"A_story_of_growing_up\"><\/span>A story of growing up<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\r\nGrowing up, Bull Jack was picked on and was small - he learned to take a beating.

At 12 he took his entire life savings and had a stone carving made for her in the ossuary of the slums. Another time when a snitch sold him out (the mark was way too powerful caught without surprise), he kept his word and the snitch was not hurt by him and suffered no \"blow back\" for betraying the mark. He had to give up his life savings as a bounty hunter at that point to save his own life from the bounty owner. Later, 3 months when the mark returned to the slums, he sold the information to an information broker of who had betrayed the mark. Then he waited, following the snitch until the mark ambushed him. He made sure the snitch saw him in the shadows before he was killed by the old mark, then killed the mark - even though the bounty was no longer valid, he had given his word.\n\r\n  <\/div>\r\n  <div id=\"char-story4\" class=\"tab-pane fade\">\r\n    <h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"How_the_character_came_to_be_in_the_group\"><\/span>How the character came to be in the group<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\r\n\n\r\n  <\/div>\r\n  <div id=\"char-story5\" class=\"tab-pane fade\">\r\n    <h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"XP\/CP\/Inspirations_Gained_and_Spent\"><\/span><i class=\"fa fa-trophy\"><\/i> XP\/CP\/Inspirations Gained and Spent<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\r\n\n\r\n  <\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\r\n\r\n<\/script>\r\n\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&#8211; A character of Thug Life &#8211; Hard Times in Ados!<\/p>\n<a role=\"link\" class=\"rtp-readmore\" title=\"Read more on Bull Jack Blacknails &#8211; Character\" href=../../../../22http/incarnanet/host/kelly-berger/char/bull-jack/22_995974733.html rel=\"nofollow\">Read More \u2192<\/a>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"parent":326,"menu_order":48,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":[],"categories":[],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/3320"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3320"}],"version-history":[{"count":4,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/3320\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":3443,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/3320\/revisions\/3443"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/326"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3320"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3320"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3320"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
