The Weslay Road goes easy to the The Barony of Craynth, and connects to the Rodgensen Road leading southwest to Danbevy. The strange and ancient Lonely Road goes to the north from the vale into the unknown. The Viscount has maintained good relationships with the Pine Tribes in the area, and there are the occasional tribesmen for trading, or even some local celebrations &#8211; such as the spring fair in honor of Ezrilus. Religion in the area is mixed, mostly those who venerate the Wyld Faith; the Green Church has a presence as an organized flock in Correl &#8211; the capital of the vale. The Lightbringers maintain a small following &#8211; radically vehement and constantly preaching. Mizras has a small enclave which exists solely to train and supplement for the defense against the constant raids by Orrish in the night. <\/div>\n<p><b>Culture<\/b>: It is somewhat remote, and like of all Rhyl its people follow most of the Freelander culture &#8211; they are independent, self-sufficient and distrustful of outsiders. Outsiders are especially distrusted in the vale, as the potential for disturbing the long dead spirits and bones of the giants is great with the many treasure seekers, archeologists, and historians.\n<\/p>\n<p>Each year there are games and challenges (&#8220;Test of Seven&#8221;) and from the region is sent the best to be a candidate as a High King&#8217;s ranger; a source of great pride in the region. <\/p><\/div>\n<div id=\"population\" class=\"population\">Population 18,000-21,000 permanent (some transient during harvest season); It is primarily human in population, with the occasional elven trading party, a few half elves and elven outcasts. The elves and leaders of the vale have age old treaties for logging and forest management.<\/div>\n<div id=\"rulership\" class=\"rulership\"><b>Rulership<\/b>: The Vicount of Meargensdale rules the vale.
