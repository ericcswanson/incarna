History records the willing retirement of its members, but in reality they did not go willingly. To take power from the councils, the Emperor had one of its biggest militant defenders eradicated. They were sent en mass to the north, where they fought for years &#8211; thinning their numbers. When the last band was returning to Gwinn, having served their allotted time, they were ambushed and taken captive.

They were asked to all sacrifice themselves for Gwinn, for the greater glory of the families represented. All of them agreed, to the last man. At this time there were more than 120 of them. They were all sworn to the emperor and to The Confessor &#8211; the highest and most dangerous priest of Elancil in the Gwinnish service. A mission that would affect the fate of the burgeoning empire and the world was about to be undertaken.<\/p>\n<p>The order escorts The Confessor to a remote place in the north, and there seems to be a lot of resistance from the minions of the Lich Lords to their safe arrival at the place of meeting. At least half are killed in getting to the agreed upon frigid locale. There, the high priest meets Ladril Kolman, the Bard of Bluesong and a Black Gorgon in service to the High King. The members of the order are witness to a clandestine meeting between the two where the fate of the Steel Realms is set forward. In the meeting, the two sides agree on a plot to put the north in a pincer. Gwinn will put pressure on the north while agents of the High King hinders any aid. Eventually the \u201cfree north\u201d must turn to Gladnor for assistance. In return, the High King will miraculously win a pitched battle. In the settlement, he will recognize the seizure of Tarmysia (under the pretense that it was originally a Sea King settlement and culture) and the northern isles in exchange for peace. The Emperor will pay a nominal tribute to assist in the war against the Winter Host. <\/p>\n<p>The order marches The Confessor back, and the minions of the Lich Lords whittle their number down to 18 before they reach the western coastal area. They must sense something about the meeting, their agents are everywhere. Even some priests of various gods and fanatics confront them &#8211; though none seem to know the specifics of why their own god may have sent them to stop The Confessor.<\/p>\n<p>The eighteen remaining members of the order are returned to Gwinn. There they enjoy a week of celebration and decadence, as only a king may know. High on drink, drugs, and pleasure, they are easily corralled. Taken on the emperors own ship, they continue their partying out to see. All on board are imbibing. The guards have been told the order has betrayed the Gwinnish cause and they must die. The members of the order believe they are being sacrificed in a holy ceremony. The following boat ropes up and at dawn the members of the order seem to comply in their drugged condition and are beheaded. This ends the only witness to the evil deal that the High King of Gladnor and the rising Empire of Gwinn have made. <\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<hr \/>\n<div id=\"popmapsrlm\" class=\"hidden\"><a href=../../../../22/wp-content/uploads/srlm-map-handgif/index_1662929950.html><img src=../../../../22/wp-content/uploads/srlm-map-handgif/index_1662929950.html alt=\"Steel Realms Map\" lazyload \/><\/a><\/div><div class=\"modal fade\" id=\"basicModal\" tabindex=\"-1\" role=\"dialog\" aria-labelledby=\"basicModal\" aria-hidden=\"true\">\r\n    <div class=\"modal-dialog\">\r\n        <div class=\"modal-content\">\r\n            <div class=\"modal-header\">\r\n            <button type=\"button\" class=\"close\" data-dismiss=\"modal\" aria-hidden=\"true\">X<\/button>\r\n            <h4 class=\"modal-title\" id=\"myModalLabel\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Modal_title\"><\/span>Modal title<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\r\n            <\/div>\r\n            <div class=\"modal-body\" id=\"myModalPop\">\r\n            <\/div>\r\n    <\/div>\r\n  <\/div>\r\n<\/div><script>jQuery(\"a[class^='dndclass-cleric'],a[class*=' dndclass-cleric']\").prop(\"href\",\"\/characters\/class\/cleric\");jQuery(\"a[class^='dndclass-fighter'],a[class*=' dndclass-fighter']\").prop(\"href\",\"\/characters\/class\/fighter\");jQuery(\"a[class^='dndclass-ranger'],a[class*=' dndclass-ranger']\").prop(\"href\",\"\/characters\/class\/ranger\");jQuery(\"a[class^='dndclass-barbarian'],a[class*=' dndclass-barbarian']\").prop(\"href\",\"\/characters\/class\/barbarian\");jQuery(\"a[class^='dndclass-druid'],a[class*=' dndclass-druid']\").prop(\"href\",\"\/characters\/class\/druid\");<\/script>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>An offshoot of a more ancient order, it was reserved for nobility of the three ancient &#8216;Clan&#8217; houses of the Laerthian Council.
