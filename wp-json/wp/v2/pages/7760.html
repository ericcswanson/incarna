He fends for himself off the land, and enjoys the freedom of seeing and traveling great distances with the company of birds, insects and the grass of the plains. He works his way north along the coast, encountering his first villages. Mostly fishing hovels, his visage triggered screams and often running. While they hid, he would get a sense of things needing to be moved, boats and nets hauled, and minor repairs. He enticed them back with a willingness to work in trade, and used his animals to enjoin the humans to be friendly. He learned to swim and to haul large nets in shore hugging boats and from the shallows &#8211; it was good to develop his patience. His temper would get the best of him in many places, and he would eventually leave. It took him a year to make his way to Hiddzwaur (the Kaithlen were pushed out) &#8211; following the tales and news from the greatest town of the area. It took all his abilities to avoid the Kaithlen and the burgeoning struggle that tore the area apart. Humans were trying to settle the ancient Kaithlen lands, Kaithlen were roaming in small packs, and folks were tying to create farmsteads to work the land. Hiddzwaur was the island of stability for 50 miles, and a destination for the few seeking their fortune unconventionally &#8211; at least 1-2 travelers a day would pass through. He was told by the coastal villagers that rumors had it for years that it was growing and attracting &#8220;city types&#8221; slowly, Caramin decided that he may find a need for his talents there. Hiddzwaur was no longer active though, but had many farmsteads and a thriving maritime community that was rebuilding around the ruins. Fear of the Kaithlen kept many away still. It reminded him of the early days of Dorath. This made it a clear target, and Caramin knew that he had matured and honed his skills in the hundreds of miles to get to the town &#8211; he was ready. He spent 2 years, a near permanent member of the militia. He lived simply, and for trade in goods. Because of his aversion to material wealth, his friendly dog, and quiet disposition using all he had learned, he felt he was accepted swiftly compared to everywhere else he had been. There was a growing movement to rename the town, though to what no one could decide (&#8220;Salt Marsh&#8221; being the name with the most weight). While not actively patrolling outside the walls, he could often be found on the docks, catapulting children into the cool waters under the sun. For once, he actually felt part of a community. <\/p>\n<h2 id=\"hid\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Hiddzwar\/Salt_Marsh_Troubles\"><\/span>Hiddzwar\/Salt Marsh Troubles<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Though the Kaithlen had moved on to prevent war in the area &#8211; the savage ones stay and make trouble. He is constantly scouting and using his owl to send a red streamer to steadings when he sees the Kaithlen from a distance &#8211; but he avoids open conflict. The Kaithlen eventually understand who and what he is, and why the folk they seek to predate on they find too often hunkered in defensive steadings, prepared and armed as much as they can. They have not yet come to hunt him specifically, but he is a known thorn in their side. They grow to grudgingly respect him. Ultimately with less death, the Kaithlen are also harassed less. The temple to Medja was used to rebuild other buildings, stone by stone it was taken apart. Sometimes Caramin takes a piece of stone from the temple and leaves it for the Kaithlen outside the walls, a reminder of better memories AND their choice to leave, most do not appreciate the message. <\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"People_of_Hiddzwar\/Salt_March\"><\/span>People of Hiddzwar\/Salt March<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>FISH LEGS = hired us to tip crates into harbor; former pirate and smuggler and operative for Vern Kelps)<br \/>\nVERN KELPS = Local fishmonger (mogul of the area\/wealthiest in town)<br \/>\nHAPPY FIELDS = Former paladin of Methrane; drunkard<br \/>\nBENTER SMITH = Head Jailer<br \/>\nJOHN &#8220;Hammer&#8221; MILLER &#8211; back bone of the militia\/2nd in charge<br \/>\nKENNETH GREEN = head of the militia\/bureaucrat<br \/>\nMARCUS FISHER = Harbormaster<br \/>\nTED BAILEY = &#8220;Baileys Bar&#8221; (bar)\/and [separate] Inn Owner (expensive; plus penny hangs)<br \/>\n&gt; our &#8220;sign&#8221; for trouble is his staff brings me a drink (i dont drink)<br \/>\nFATHER CORPUS WHALER = Penitent\/devout of church of the elements (Laussio\/water); cartographer<\/p>\n<p>Militia = 10 at any given time + captain and second (&#8220;Hammer&#8221;) in charge<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Big_fish_festival\"><\/span>Big fish festival<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p> We (Caramin + Mufasa) are conscripted to serve as security.

All of the Guardsmen you&#8217;ve spoken to were given orders by either the Mayor or the &#8216;Hammer&#8217; to keep people out. No explanation given.<br \/>\nThe locals who were at the mine during the attack only know that the raiders came in, killed whoever was in their path and ran into the mines. They never saw anyone come out, but before the attacks on the town had stopped they were told to evacuate and then the following day informed that the area was closed down and that they were not to go back. The town treasury even covered their wages for the month. Cursory talks do not reveal who initially gave the order to evacuate. It seems most people were told by other Miners and laborers that they needed to get out.<\/p>\n<p>Is there any presence of faith in the town?<br \/>\n&gt; For information on the Divine, mystical, odd or historical your best sources are any unique people making port (long shot), the Mayor (Wyeth Green), Father Corpus Whaler (A penitent of the elemental faith, Devoted to Lauccio) and MAYBE the Militia captain Kenneth Green.<br \/>\n&gt; The Ex Paladin, Happy Field (No one argues with him about that being his name any more), was a follower of Methran. Methran is the Conqueror, the aspect of war among the Lords of Chaos. &#8220;War is only a tool to determine divine right.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Is there anyone at the mine who was there when the raiders hit it, and if so, did they say what they were after?<br \/>\n&gt; Locals who MIGHT know more, this is all what you can get through normal conversation.

Ted confirms we are the ones shes looking for. Crowd starts talking.<br \/>\n&gt; She offers us a job: locate an island to scout out (who wont scare people with demon horns); 2 part =<br \/>\n1st: sail to leechwaters (prefer &#8220;&#8221;\/east 75 miles) to get info and tool for 100 silvers each (hazard pay separate)<br \/>\n&gt; she, her vessel and crew are not allowed to make port there (dont mention we work for her)<br \/>\n2nd: find isle and scout for cash\/gear (find pendant) &#8211; lost shrine of Achtval &#8211; third lord of chaos, AKA &#8220;changing lady&#8221; (fluid form\/confusion\/freedom &#8211; &#8220;do as though wilt&#8221;); Zendrevs can now find the island with the stone in the sextant we delivered to her.

Not good enough for Caramin. That relies on her being alive.<\/p>\n<p>Drops off at delta of silty river via rowboat. They will wait in bog and whistle a certain way to summon them to row us out. Night more ideal; ask for Timmy Jim, say the &#8220;hot one sent us&#8221; and get package.<br \/>\nLeechwaters here we come. We came from Saltmarsh &#8211; looking for work as mercenaries.<br \/>\n+2 hours and scout: argue on road, lots of leeches, venomous eels (delicacy) in muck, Mufasa gets bit = fuck this place. pop 250, ground rises as dry, lots of built stone structures more than straw and mud; head to tavern. Locals want us out, we want work, referred to TJ, he says we are weird couriers, but OK. Asks us toconfirm who sent us, Caramin gives him 5 seconds. Bob ferries us out to dry through bog. Bobs tells Caramin how to prepare as exotic food.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"First_Journey_to_Tidesbreak_Island\"><\/span>First Journey to Tidesbreak Island<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>1 week time limit on Tidesbreak Island (singular, not part of a chain)<br \/>\nLongboat takes us in to 20&#8242; (chaos ward) &#8211; we dont really get a feeling, but Caramin feels like holy ground<br \/>\nUndergrowth\/Overgrowth = none\/light scrub<br \/>\nTrees = no\/small\/scrub<br \/>\nAnimal Population = birds, crabs, fish<br \/>\nElevation and grade = (highest point? 75&#8242; spire) up to center point<br \/>\nFresh water on island? just rain<br \/>\nCaves? unknown<br \/>\nPLAN = follow shore line and look for caves, check spire first<br \/>\nSpire: Spire not natural! looks it from a distance. Alcove: Shrine to Lauccio (elemental water) at the base of the spire. Carved prayers. Footprints &#8211; barefoot, older; 1-2 months into and leave to north; clean, old offerings of sea plant, coral, etc. (later we find it was the elemental priest in Hiddzwaur)<br \/>\nClimb to the top: etched into stone = combined holy symbol of elementals, line representing Dennio = deeper\/ticker (earth); blood into groove &#8211; it glows. Caramin leaves all the silver they have as an offering &#8211; 424 silvers tucked into the rocks. Get the sense that Dennio power was used to thrust the spire up out of the earth. <\/p>\n<p>We do a march around the island, cursory exploration, find nothing. We are forced to leave the island because of bad weather. We race back to town, in danger of the boat being tossed in a storm. When we return, we re-provision, and Mufasa is thrown into jail for assault and battery &#8211; Caramin does not intervene. Caramin takes the misc. goods and weapons (cutlass, short sword, dagger, hand axe) and donates them to the Elemental temple in town. Caramin gives the elemental priest the ciphered journals to see if he can decipher them. He tells them where we got them. <\/p>\n<p><b>Eric<\/b> [Athol] comes from sailing and merchant background and probably had money in his family at some point. He replaces Mufasa to aid in fighting. Looks like Caribbean descent. He is big, and strong, and heavily armored. <\/p>\n<p><b>Kry&#8217;lin<\/b> [Ben] received a vision outside of town, the vision makes sense when he sees Caramin and delivers &#8220;you missed something&#8221;. He explains his vision of a stone spire out in the ocean, and a false image of something being there that should not be there. Relatives were attached to Nanto &#8211; the spirit of fire. Caramin bows to the gods who obviously brought the holy man hither. Krylin the halfling assumes leadership of the group. <\/p>\n<p>We return to Tidesbreak Island <\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Second_Journey_to_Tidesbreak_Island\"><\/span>Second Journey to Tidesbreak Island<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Confirm that tracks went off to the north, someone kneeled and squatted. Eric picks up Krylin and takes him up the spire. The wind buffets them. Eric makes the climb to the top. Silver is still there. Clue is there is something under the spire. We find a plate hidden by debris. Caramin finds a thing at the top of the shrine, a handhold stone moves and it opens the plate in the shrine being held shut. We go down a stone stair case for 5 minutes. Water is running down the walls. We are at sea level, and there is standing water, the stairs go down into. It IS low tide. The hallway leads for a minute and a half underwater to a lighted chamber. The torch is lighting the chamber with a witch green light. Passage leads to a lighted area with non flickering light. Caramin stealths ahead to see whats up. A creatures comes out of the water behind the others and attacks them as Caramin scouts ahead. Another creature appears. They are made of dried seaweed, coral, rock and have 4 eel heads on their back. Gross smell of rotten seaweed when they die. Kylin checks it out (similar to golem &#8211; maybe Dennio and Laussio working together?), while Caramin explores forward.<br \/>\nRoom under the spire &#8211; line where the light ends. At the edge of a shrine. Mess of crystals, rock, etc and splinters light in some pattern?<br \/>\nThrow a shoe in, shoe stops for 15 seconds and then recovers its fall.<br \/>\nTime slows. We enter. Corpse looking thing behind the curtain of light. Its a vampire Casua.<br \/>\nCaramin asks if he has a message for his people &#8211; to the emperor: &#8220;Beware the gifts of other lords.&#8221; From a servant to Achtvaal. Been down for a long time, longer with time dilation. It says the chaos lords are vying for power &#8211; Tyranus especially is rising and has influence in the world more than he ever had before. Cataclysmic power!!! Methran the conqueror is not doing much. Caramin lets down his sanity to commune with the spirits of the place &#8211; reality warps.<br \/>\n1) lose leg or genitalia = resisted<br \/>\n2) drunk = x2 healing rate<br \/>\n3) burn 1 CHA all within 100m = hear as though next to me = resisted<br \/>\n4) Powerful build (1 size larger for carrying capacity)<br \/>\nWe learn that the situation has served its purpose. Insight into Casua; emperor has direct tie to Achtvaal = does not age. Caramin has insights of the emperor throughout time. Caramin offers his arm for blood. The vampire says he was the emperors best friend, helped him get the throne. Wants to kill emperor, but cant remember why. Caramin dons the necklace and gets an exact sense of where the chaos shrine on the island is. When the vampire meets Zendros, he says she is a much more elaborate transformation than his. No explanation. She seems in awe of him. <\/p>\n<p>Take the vampire shackles.<br \/>\nScroll: Blessing of Achtvaal. <\/p>\n<p>Gives us a mark: she gets half of 2500 bounty<br \/>\nMarcus Condars = child sacrifice on the misty coast. Has some training as a wizard. Maybe sacrifice to get power fast. paranoid. Does not trust anyone &#8211; employs mercenaries, has no friends. Targets kids who are a bigger challenge &#8211; not just easy pickings. Prefers boys. Stays close to the coast for quick transport out.<br \/>\nVillage of Pederast (150 pop), misty coast. Get dropped off down the coast. <\/p>\n<p>100 silvers pouch, 400 jewelry pouch, book &#8211; methodical in Impari > in mill<br \/>\ndisguise, witchcraft stuff, spell book? > in hut<\/p>\n<p>City council wants Kry\u2019lin to stick around and work with Caramin.

Leave the mules<br \/>\nThen go west &#8211; its the most used route. Caramin handles mules. At three miles, we pound the first marker in. 20mile traces of lizard folk lair; we map them to a half mile diameter area.<br \/>\nArea well travel, but Kaithlen and Lizard folk never cross the line &#8211; they are funneling travelers through no mans land between them. Exact route to go west. WE find stones to mark the width and mark them with arrows (5 each side).<br \/>\nCaramin stays 2 miles out, savage Kaithlen get near him and observe the city at night. Report in to council.<br \/>\nDay 3: North 20 miles. To the NW we see small forest = total 40 mile distance from salt marsh<br \/>\nThat night 2 scrawny kaithlen attack at down for food. 2 short swords, dagger, light crossbow &#8211; no provisions or equipment<br \/>\nDay 4: go to forest?
