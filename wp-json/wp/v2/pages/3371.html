The Captain is in a good mood and feels he will start making the island a regular stop.<br \/>\nWe continue our voyage and get back to the Diamond Spider and Spider Brass the box.  He smashes the box with a rock.  It was empty.  Ours was a decoy.<br \/>\nSpider said we performed admirably.  He asked about the island.  We told him of our adventure.  He pays us 150 GP each.<br \/>\nMeena buys Breastplate and 1 potion of Cure Wounds (using 100 GP of party funds &#038; 350 of hers).  Found out GM had given us max wealth for our class.  Meena has 200 GP to start.<br \/>\nSpider has another job for us.  He has an archeological site of an ancient sun-lord\u2019s crypt.  Some Goblins have taken over the crypt.  A couple of his people will go along as guides.  It is on the edge of the Orcish\/Dwarvish boarder.  We can keep anything we find.  He offers 500 GP each if we succeed in clearing the Goblins out.  Plus expenses. Also 2 potions of Healing.<br \/>\nWe clean up and have a relaxing night and a good breakfast.  Stickwicket Toastcrumb is waiting for us in the common room of the inn.  He takes us to the dock.  We will travel on another Halfling flat bottom boat.  Captain Hardbottle will see us to our destination.<br \/>\nWe sail for 3-4 days.  There is a day\u2019s hike and a row across the lake.  The lake is 5-6 miles across.  Our guides get the boat.  We all have to help row.  One of our guides is named Sherlock, the other is Priestwick.<br \/>\nWe make it across the lake.  We tie off the boat.  We see the ruins on a nearby bluff.  There is a white door that looks ominous.<br \/>\nAfter our guides make camp, we decide to leave them there and take a walk to the door.  It\u2019s actually a stone slab with a counter weight.  Meena tries to open it, but it doesn\u2019t budge.<br \/>\nWe hear a scream and \u201cbear\u201d from the men at camp.  Alta and Meena start running back to camp.  Eera and Singin come slower.<br \/>\nAlta runs up to the bear and attacks with her quarter staff.  She hits him.<br \/>\nSingen casts Bardic inspiration on Alta.  Then he shoots with the bow for dbl damage.<br \/>\nMeena shoots the bear, hitting it.<br \/>\nThe bear attacks Alta, but misses his attacks.<br \/>\nPriestwick stabs at it with a spear. He hits it and takes it down.  Priestwick is injured.   He pulls out a potion of healing.<br \/>\nEera and Meena skin the bear.  It is very skinny.<br \/>\nWe carry the boat up to use as shelter in case something else comes up.  The night passes.<br \/>\nAlta notices that Eera is missing her burned antler, which means she can\u2019t cast spells.<br \/>\nMeena finds tracks leading from Eera towards the white door.  We head out following the track.  About half way there, we find a goblin lying prone on the ground.  The ground is icy and slick.  He has a head wound.  We wake him up.  Eera\u2019s talisman is on the ground beside him.<br \/>\nWe question him.  He tells us you need to say \u201cI\u2019m a goblin, let me in\u201d and the door will open.  Singen loses patience and kills him.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>World of Ph&#8217;yrin Tys! Game Master = Gazza 4\/8\/15 We feel the island is \u201csafe\u201d now.
