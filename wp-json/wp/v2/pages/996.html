Their warriors and shaman still make secret pilgrimages to it to this day.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"bordered know\">As night falls, a man comes to see you. He introduces himself as Temiri. He says he is from an academic brotherhood in South Drift, and believes that the party has killed the infamous ork champion named Coreblack. &#8220;Coreblack is a menacing power in the north. He has rallied hundreds of Orrish to his banner time and again, invading, putting villages to the torch, and causing the rise of heros and men to stop him &#8211; but has never himself been caught in a dozen years.He has never come this far south.&#8221; He shakes his head and frowns&#8230; and he tells you  there has been a few disappearances lately around the area, and the bodies of those who vanished &#8211; a tradesman, a local politician, watchman, copper, and others were all part of the skeletons and zombies he had with him. One of Coreblack\u2019s signatures is to attack targets using the undead animations of their families and friends. The town had his order review the found possessions the party brought back from the attackers and trinkets and jewelry all identified the victims.\n<\/div>\n<p>Temiri wishes to buy the party a round in thanks for returning the few possessions, and for putting their spirits to final rest. After an hour of small talk, he will turn to one of the party members and say. <\/p>\n<h4><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Temiri_the_Diviner-2\"><\/span>Temiri the Diviner<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n<p>Temiri (of <a href=../../../../22/verse/set/steel-realms/occult/house-mataff/22_997399633.html>House Mataff<\/a>) believes himself was the target of a round-up, but he has able to draw on his occult powers and avoid them by hiding ahead of time. He has since looked into it, discovered a terrible force in the area, and is afraid for his life to look any closer at what is going on. The very thing that has drawn him to the area \u2013 The Emerald Falls \u2013 now is likely to hold an evil more powerful than a dozen mages. Temiri has been studying the area and learning to draw upon its power to enhance his own, he is familiar with the locale and the myths of it going back to the time when the Pine Tribes ruled the land. He believes their warriors and shaman still make secret pilgrimages to it to this day.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"bordered know-more\">Temiri says that he has sensed a god-like power with his meager powers. It is the time of the Green Falls \u2013 Twice per year (spring and fall) the falls at Calibri Lake turn green. Normally he uses this time to enhance his own powers, but he says to stay away. There is a power tapping into the falls, and the barriers between worlds is lowering and that dangerous things will prowl the lands nearby. &#8220;Already they have come for me \u2013 but my own powers warned me. They ransacked my home, and fortunately did not possess the powers to perceive me, hidden as i was by my own magics. Even your own intuition is telling you to stay away &#8211; I suggest perhaps we should law low until the Time of The Interloper is past.&#8221; He says this, but its clear he may not believe it \u2013 he is fearful.\n<\/div>\n<p><P>He will let that sink in and let the party talk and ask questions. If the party decides to lay low as he says, he will excuse himself to leave and get supplies and leave the area. If the party indicates they will stay and fight whatever is coming, he will be visibly relieved. <\/p>\n<div class=\"bordered know-more\">&#8220;I think something is happening and no one is likely to believe me who has not seen these forces at work already. It&#8217;s no coincidence that the cosmos has sent you this way.

She looks into his window &#8211; without care who sees her.

At the postal depot, the local Sheriff deputizes him and he swears you in as his posse. &#8220;Now whatever we do, we do for righteousness.&#8221; The Sheriff only looks grimly on, and Temiri outlines his plan of tracking down anyone who was helping Coreblack. Temiri thinks it&#8217;s important to go back to the place where Coreblack tried to ambush the party and maybe he as a diviner can pick up his trail from there. This far from his normal grounds, Temiri figures he must have had a lair of some sorts. &#8220;A powerful black knight like him does not get this far without a base of operations.&#8221;<\/div>\n<p>Divining powers allow him to follow the party to the bottom of the ridge and east. North then into the snow, and out onto the plain. The party will say that the area looks familiar at some point &#8211; exactly where Temiri believed they were.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"bordered know-more-yet\">Recent snows have covered the scene of any battle. The cold embrace of the coming winter has eradicated all else. But Temiri scratches through the snow into the hard ground, laying the framework of his spell. He begins the ritual and his eyes widen, as if he is seeing something only he can. The he points, and slowly turns in a circle until he stops. He follows the way he pointed. There is no path, but he seems to know his way. <\/div>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Coreblacks_Camp\"><\/span>Coreblacks Camp<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Coreblack\u2019s camp seems to be a jagged gash cut into a low rise facing north.

There are 4 goblins guarding it with a crossbow each and 6 bolts a piece (potent weapons for orrish!) and 2 spiders of Go-Zen!! Crossbow (poison; DC 12 Con)<\/p>\n<p>In the camp there is evidence that instructions written in Galdnorian were being read by Coreblack. The area that the party was ambushed in was marked in a crude map in a locked chest (buried in rubble &#8211; a key is buried under s smaller pile of rubble) &#8211; ridge line is laid out a building marked at the base in trader town with symbol of Sun Stealer Clergy (Religion 15).
