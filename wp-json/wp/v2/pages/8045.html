As leader of the band of adventurers, he often leads from the front. If he is going into a situation where he does not think he can react, or if will be particularly punishing he will don his fine breastplate from time in the Queens service. Though it slows him down, it changes his tactics almost none at all.

Common born, his father is a trader, traveling between Dunstrand and Oerdney (where the family business includes distant relatives). While his father intended him to work in the family trading enterprise, Belim was restless in that role and instead worked his way into the city guard of Oerdney, thence into the High King\u2019s army, and finally into the Tonbridge Dragoons. He is somewhat ambitious, as he believes proving one\u2019s loyalty to King and Country on the battlefield is the surest way for someone of his standing to advance to a higher station. His company is battlefield trained, but takes on a variety of odd tasks (some some interesting, some mundane) during relative peacetime; including activities such as espionage, security details, and scouting. He met his current companions on one of these \u2018assignments\u2019\u2014attempting to safeguard the reputation of a relatively minor but indiscreet noblewoman\u2014in the Dunstrand region.<\/p>\n<p>Belim and his unit have warred beside rangers in the past \u2013 and now a ranger has asked him to go to Bar-Innis. Much has been happening in what would normally be a completely out of the way place, beyond anyone\u2019s notice. However, too much has been happening there and the rangers are worried. Activity always means interest \u2013 and by who they want to know. More patrols of Orrish scouts have been followed into Dunstrand coming from the east\u2026 are they following the trail of interest, or are they reinforcements for a force already there? The court of the Earl of Bar-Innis is the pace to go. There are a group of bannermen that have sparked a lot of interest \u2013 seek them out and join their band. Find out about them and report back. You arrive in the capital of Bar-Innis, the city of Mev on 9140 CY, Month 7, +29 days.<\/p>\n<p>Belim\u2019s Journal (Intro to Dunstrand Rising)<\/p>\n<p>The scuttlebutt is that Farold Oshman (a knight in training and follower of Rastur the Lion Lord), Sandovhal Aelishan (a scholar, linguist, and decent shot with a bow \u2013 also follower of Rastur), and Hap Nii (Grollen \u2013 son of the Earl\u2019s hunstman and one time cpl. in the city watch) have all left \u2013 there seems to be some tension in the group. Whatever strange happenings are going on in the area are hard to say yet \u2013 but if these guys have enemies, now would seem the time to strike. Apparently a halfling \u2018freedom fighter\u2019 from Loamwold has just joined the ranks before you got here, and the group is celebrating the return of the Dulak brothers \u2013 2 brothers who are sons of a local land owner and grew up in the Earl\u2019s court\u2026 both have a reputation as drinkers, fighters, gamblers, and ameteur comedians\u2026 from what you have seen they are undisciplined, unpredictable, yet loyal and fierce. The rest \u2013 Morgent is the son of one of the Earl\u2019s bannermen and a magus, Porthias is away mostly, but the spiritual leader of the group and a follower of Rastur the Lion Lord (Green Church \u2013 the green church seems to be popular in these parts), and Alden \u2013 a troubleshooter who rumor has it has some skill in the magical arts. then there is the half breed half elf Hareen \u2013 accepted by the locals having grown up in court. His family is all gone. He is rash, quick with his tongue, and quite the bravado \u2013 seemingly more concerned with this looks than anything else. He works out constantly, with twin elvish short baldes, and seems quite skilled.<\/p>\n<p>(Afterward was the Troubles in Mosshaven and Dunstrand Faire adventures\u2026)<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Incarna 2 to D20 5e original Conversion (blog) Converted Belim In Incarna, there is no XP &#8211; campaign character levels are granted by the GM; flavor = &#8220;Gritty Realism&#8221; short rest = overnight\/8 hours; long rest = 1 week of every day being rest Belim, Son of Hardivan Belim, son of Hardiven Human, male, 5\u201911&#8243;, [&hellip;]<\/p>\n<a role=\"link\" class=\"rtp-readmore\" title=\"Read more on Original (Convert to 5e from i2)\" href=../../../../22http/incarnanet/host/eric-swanson/chars/belim/original/22_1111513897.html rel=\"nofollow\">Read More \u2192<\/a>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"parent":3746,"menu_order":2,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":[],"categories":[],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/8045"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=8045"}],"version-history":[{"count":3,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/8045\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":8048,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/8045\/revisions\/8048"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/3746"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=8045"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=8045"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=8045"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
