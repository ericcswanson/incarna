Its a dangerous place where ocean currents meet the evils of Dwindor Swamp, and unknown evils prowl. Those who go here are often never seen again. The ancient ruins are mostly sunk beneath the waves, but the ancient Estraga family temple still stands on a lonely peak. In this peak, a being of light long ago was given its home, and venerated by the Estraga family. It is a source of great knowledge and guidance, unending optimism and hope. Within the confines of the temple, it took to rehabilitating broken creatures it would find. Since The Sundering, the temple has become even more remote and ignored. However, to a select few, it is known as a source of knowledge and power &#8211; secrets that can be traded or bartered for if the seeker is willing to pay the price. The temple awaits such seekers, lonely and mostly fallen into obscurity. The path to it is dangerous, and those seeking it often fail. But it is to this place, that the PC&#8217;s must go, seeking knowledge locked away.\n<\/p>\n<p><b>Location<\/b>: [The Steel Realms] The fallen termple is located on the very western edge of Scar flow &#8211; the west side of the peak it is on faces the open ocean.<br \/>\n<b>Premise<\/b>: The PC&#8217;s either need some antidote or locked away piece of knowledge, or their Patron or related order needs it. They are sent to retrieve it and return.<br \/>\n> Macguffin > The GM can insert whatever knowledge or potion or item that they need to in order to give the party a reason to go.<br \/>\n<b>Story and Progress<\/b>: Arriving at the temple location is up to the GM &#8211; the Dwindor Swamp and Scar Flow are places the GM can introduce or run the party through or over to get to the temple. How the party learns the way is up to the GM &#8211; a Patron or obscure literary reference, perhaps.<br \/>\n<b>> Outcome(s) ><\/b> The PC&#8217;s should get what they have come seeking. Alternatively, they may get knowledge of what they seek.<br \/>\n<b>Challenges<\/b>: There are ways to bypass some threats by exploring. Phantoms, undead, hounds of other realms. Horrific monsters like Gibbering Mouther requiring sanity checks. A test to not disturb the graves of the fallen.<br \/>\n<b>Rewards<\/b>: Either the knowledge of what they seek or what they seek &#8211; this is the only reward gained. <\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Background\"><\/span>Background<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Estraga Family:\n<\/p>\n<p>The creature bound of light:\n<\/p>\n<p><b>What the Characters Know<\/b>: Common knowledge and Uncommon [what checks are required?].\n<\/p>\n<p><b>Hidden Knowledge<\/b>: What is completely unknown to the players (and perhaps to the NPC&#8217;s!).\n<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Timeline\"><\/span>Timeline<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>When: season<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Characters enter the picture&#8230;<\/li>\n<li><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Introduction\"><\/span>Introduction<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Narrative for the characters to get them into the adventure.\n<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Monjoi_Peak\"><\/span>Monjoi Peak<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Monjoi Peak stands almost 200 feet out of the water.\n<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Light_Bringer_Temple_of_Monjious\"><\/span>Light Bringer Temple of Monjious<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Crathern_Peak\"><\/span>Crathern Peak<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Crathern Peak is the small peak about 200 feet off the east side of Monjoi.
