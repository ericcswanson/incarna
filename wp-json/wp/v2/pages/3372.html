We say \u201cI am a goblin, open the door\u201d in goblin.  We see a shimmer and a veil is lifted.  There is a hole in the door.<br \/>\nPriestwick and Sherlock come running up and say \u201cWe\u2019ll guard the door after you go in\u201d.  (Singen is immediately suspicious).<br \/>\nSingen goes first through the door.  We see a corridor that has partially collapsed.  The footing is treacherous.  There are stairs that descend.<br \/>\nMeena climbs over the rubble, then Eera, then Sinjin, then Alta.  We all make it down the stairs across the rubble.<br \/>\nWe hear something behind us and turn to see the skeleton of a dog-like creature.<br \/>\nAlta attacks it with her quarter staff, hitting it.

There are 7 doors with animals depicted on the floor in front of each door.  On the floor is a mural of the Sun Lord with suns for eyes, with a Lady on his arm.<br \/>\nSinjin moves across the room and tries to open the large door.  It is made out of stone, as the outer door was.  After great effort, he gets the door open.  We see another set of stairs.<br \/>\nSinjin goes through the door.  A portcullis comes down on top of him.  He takes damage and falls back into the room.  He uses Second Wind to heal himself almost back to full strength.<br \/>\nHe enters a small anti-chamber with a crystal chandelier covered in moss and lichen.   He carefully checks out the room, and he falls down into a pit trap.<br \/>\nMeena throws him a rope and he climbs up.  On the other side of the room is another stairway and another room.  This one is larger and painted with yellow suns.  There is a gold sun in the middle of the room.  There is a skeleton lying in the room with a shining sword.<br \/>\nFour skeletons appear in the room with us.<br \/>\nOne of them attacks Meena but misses.<br \/>\nAnother misses Alta.

There are 3 sun inscriptions on the sword.<br \/>\nWe decide to heal ourselves and rest the night.<br \/>\nSinjin casts Identify on the sword.  Blade of the Sun Lord.  Upon touching the sword, it sets off a spear trap, but Sinjin is able to dodge it.<br \/>\nForged 350 years ago for Ka\u2019Teek.  Magical sword.  +2 Longsword (+4 against evil creatures).  It can only be used by Good alignment.  It bonds with the owner and tries to return to him if lost.  (Meena)<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>World of Ph&#8217;yrin Tys!
