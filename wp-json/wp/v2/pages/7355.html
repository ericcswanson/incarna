Its a trade hub, but it feels like the bustle is missing. The city definitely seems more empty than normal. It takes only moments to become aware of the expedition to save nearby steadings. Everyone is talking about it &#8211; it has taken a lot of people and materials. It&#8217;s not hard to find a place, many folk are renting rooms. Boarding houses and Inns seem to be full up though &#8211; there are many mercenaries in town. Apparently there have been strange &#8220;phantom soldiers&#8221; seen at night the last month, to the east. Also, everyone whispers about the escalating troubles between the trade interests. It&#8217;s a ripe market for mercenary bands and rogues! The sky is overcast, and the wind is cold and smells like salt. The streets have turned to mud and few people travel further than they have to. Something at least has got the townsfolk attention. There are people shouting in the streets and groups of people moving to the east. You can overhear what people are saying, a scene of great destruction east of Torrelsons Ford from the unending rain.\n<\/div>\n<p>Someone may try and pick a pocket, a PC may get jostled, etc. The overall chaos and pitiless weather should be stressed to the PCs.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"know\">Exhausted from your travels, you find a farm on northeast edge of town where you can stay in the stable tonight &#8211; all of you together. A meal with the locals gives you a little more background on what&#8217;s been going on locally. Strange weather, difficult seas and more Gwinnish ships off the coast, crops not coming in, violence on the docks, crime on the rise. Spirits wandering the countryside. The chaos has left the city of Torrelsons Ford without much of a constabulary. A swelling of crime began almost immediately as the constables were used to patrol outside the town &#8211; though all of it petty. Everyone seems to be taking advantage of the absence of militia, troops and civil authority. The last few days, the Barons troops and volunteers have left to try and save the surrounding areas from landslides and flash floods. The Baron himself has said he will lead another force out himself! As you eat, there is the sound of cheering coming from not far away. The farmer tells you its from the market square. It lasts only a few minutes, and is followed by the sounds of marching booted feet. The family and you all wait expectantly, but after several minutes, the sounds fade to the east.\n<\/div>\n<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Scene_Market_Pickings_of_Torrelsons_Ford\"><\/span>Scene: Market Pickings of Torrelsons Ford<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><b>Background<\/b>: This is for a character wanting to take advantage of the chaos to pick pockets and engage in small crimes of theft.<br \/>\n<b>Setup<\/b>: The characters should notice the opportunity with the loss of authority.

All day the volunteers which you are part of have been putting down planks and wood, stone and rope. Anything to ford the freshly made streams that have cut off the villages and farmsteads. Its been  an uphill battle against the ever flowing cold rain. As the sun sinks over the horizon, warm spiced cider and food is finally going out. You stand in a tent, listening to the rain fall and wolfing down the food so long in coming from the Baron\u2019s troop train. The entire camp is on edge. House Malor\u2019s standard flies next to the Baron\u2019s command tent. Magic is afoot &#8211; the foul weather is not be natural. Everyone seems to know this, and the tension is high. Dark thunder clouds come in from the west. They come in low, with a deep rumble. The camp is in an uproar, beasts are terrified, men look to the sky, and House Malor agents enact some obvious magics around the tent that houses themselves and the Baron\u2019s men.\n<\/div>\n<div>DC 14 Survival > Something&#8217;s not right, you know you better get out of the tent! <\/div>\n<div class=\"know-more\">Under the tent, tendrils of water snake under the edges and begin to soak the floor.

There is silence for several minutes as clouds roil and blacken and obscure what&#8217;s left of the sun as it sets.

A monster seemingly made of mud, kelp, and and brine undulates and oozes everywhere &#8211; swinging tendrils wildly at first, then calming in a focussed assault on you.
