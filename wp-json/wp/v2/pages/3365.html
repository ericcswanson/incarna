It take about half an hour for the smell of rot to dissipate.<br \/>\nAn Elf woman appears from the forest.  She sits down about 10 feet from the party.  She says her name is  Hamai.  She is from the council of the Elves and asks what our business is.<br \/>\nDreyfala answers her and introduces the party.  He tells her we are seeking the first component of the golden shield.<br \/>\nShe says they know of our needs and will be willing to help us.  But we have more to do to impress the council.  She asks that we follow the path through the forest and she will meet us later.<br \/>\nWe walk for a long time.  The trees are dense and it\u2019s hard to see the sun.  After about 2 hours we come to a clearing and see Hamai.  She asks us to sit.<br \/>\nShe tells us the council is not completely convinced of our worthiness.  She has made arrangements to travel to the Nuraldie Clan on the frontier, and assist them.  If we do this quest, we may swing the council our way.<br \/>\nDrayfala notices henna tattoos.  She is a member of the Unseely.  They are contrary and somewhat evil.<br \/>\nShe stands and waves her arms and dust settles on us all.  She is laughing as she disappears into the forest.  We fall asleep and have pleasant dreams.  We wake in the morning feeling very refreshed.<br \/>\nWe don our gear.  A path opens in the forest.  We decide to follow it.  We walk until noon.  The forest thins out and we hear a thunderous river.  We see an Elven township.<br \/>\nThe village quiets down as we approach, and we are approached by a young looking Elf.  He says, \u201cYou must be the outsiders that Hamai sent\u201d.  He is Arias Goldbrow.  We introduced ourselves.<br \/>\nHe says they face a threat that threatens to cause them to leave their home.  They are being threatened by Hobgoblins.  Many years ago, they fought the hobgoblins and defeated them.  Lately, the old Hobgoblin fort has been active with noises and strange doings.  He would like us to check it out and see what is going on.<br \/>\nArias points to the ground and he mumbles an incantation.  The ground clears and he draws a map of the area.  It\u2019s about a 3 mile hike along the river to the first outpost and another 5 miles in the forest is the fortress.<br \/>\nWe make it to the outpost.  We realize something is following us.  It is an owl.  Drayfala motions to it to come.  It flies down and lands on a branch.  Kam asks if it can speak, and it says in Elvish \u201cBetter than you\u201d.<br \/>\nWe ask if he is watching us for the Nuraldie?  He says he is watching us.  He is aware of our quest.  We tell him we will continue on and he flies off.<br \/>\nMeena finds a ford of the river to approach the Outpost.  We make it across using ropes.<br \/>\nWe search the brush approaching the outpost and find a set of stairs leading to the outpost.  We decide to check the perimeter.<br \/>\nThe tower is two stories of stone, on a hill of 30 feet.  It\u2019s muddy and hard to walk but we make it through.  The river is up against the hill.  We double back around the point toward the base of the stair.  Something seems to be watching us with cold dead eyes.<br \/>\nWe check the other side of the stairs.  We come to the base of the rise to the tower.  It is overgrown and seems to be growing so it protects the buildings.<br \/>\nThe stairs are covered in brambles.  Modax casts Thunder Wave and the stairs clear.  We move up the stairs.  We see a compartment that opened from the Thunder Wave.  Modax checks it and finds an old lacquered box that jingle with the sound of coins.  Kam Detects Magic and it is Magical (alteration).  Modax opens it.  There is 100 GP, and a glass potion bottle with green liquid.<br \/>\nWe get to the top and there is a 2 feet clearing.  It is very quiet.  Drayfala start to whistle a tune.  We see a small pen and nothing has been touched for a long time.  Meena notices an area of newer growth.  She hacks the old growth away to take a look.  She notices a path of newer growth heading toward the tower.  We hear a loud scream from something in the tower.<br \/>\nWe take cover and we notice the briars are starting to grow back.  We see a figure coming from the tower, dragging its foot and screaming as if in great pain.  It is tall and skinny and black cloaked.<br \/>\nDrayfala casts Daylight, as it seems to be getting darker.<br \/>\nMeena shoots with her bow and hits once.<br \/>\nKam casts Chill Touch,<br \/>\nMeena is hit twice with an arrow.<br \/>\nDrayfala shoots, hitting but he seems to ignore it.<br \/>\nModax hits with Magic Missiles<br \/>\nBalder hits with his crossbow.<br \/>\nThe figure throws his bow and falls backwards.<br \/>\nKam moves forward to check him out.  It gets lighter as he gets closer.  He sees a path of dead foliage, but only the long bow is seen.<br \/>\nWe hear another scream.  Drayfala is afraid.  There is another figure.<br \/>\nMeena attacks and hits 3 times (one a crit).<br \/>\nKam casts Chill Touch.<br \/>\nThe figure holds his sword in one hand and he casts a black spray at us.  We are in the dark.<br \/>\nMeena casts Hellish Rebuke and he burns and the sword drops.<br \/>\nWe decide to head toward the tower.<br \/>\nMeena casts Cure Wounds on herself and gets back 3 pts.  Drayfala heals her back another 10.<br \/>\nWe enter through the broken door.  Balder is in the lead.  He notices a frost on the metal.  He pushes through the door.  The area becomes covered by frost and ice.  Balder and Meena take cold damage.<br \/>\nWe see another figure with a black sword.  It attacks Balder.<br \/>\nMeena attacks hitting once.<br \/>\nModax casts Scorching Ray, hitting twice.<br \/>\nThe figure moves towards Modax, screaming.  Kam starts to bleed from his orifices.  He has disadvantage on his attacks and when hit again will be stunned.<br \/>\nModax is hit by the sword.<br \/>\nDrayfala moves in and takes out his Holy Symbol.  He attempts to Turn him but fails.<br \/>\nKam shoots with his bow, critting him.<br \/>\nBalder attacks hitting and critting.<br \/>\nMeena hits 3 times.<br \/>\nModax attacks with his spear, hitting once.<br \/>\nThe creature causes all but Modax to have disadvantage on Charisma and extra damage on hits.<br \/>\nHe attacks Modax hitting him.<br \/>\nDrayfala casts Lesser Restoration on Kam and Meena.<br \/>\nWe destroy the creature on the next turn.<br \/>\nDrayfala heals Kam, Modax and Meena.<br \/>\nThe gloom fades in the tower.  There is a homemade throne.  The walls are covered by Orcish of a tale of hate and desire for revenge upon the Elves.  A friend came to worship at the feet of the Hobgoblin lord.  We think this figure was the once head of the out post, where he died.  The other figure was his minion.<br \/>\nDrayfala consecrates the room with the help of the Elven forest.<br \/>\nWe find goblets, and elven treasure (600 GP).  Also a rusty keychain with 7 keys.  They are cold to the touch, but warming as we handle them.<br \/>\nWe search the tower and find a root cellar.  The rest is burnt and looted.<br \/>\nWe take a long rest.<\/p>\n<p>The Fort has an outer wall with many holes.  There are several watchtowers.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>World of Ph&#8217;yrin Tys! Game Master = Kelly Berger 1\/27\/16 The Briarwild collapses on itself and disappears.
