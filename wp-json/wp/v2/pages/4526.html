Their primary goal is the stability and safety of the duchy and its rulers. It is both an order, and at its top positions sits a hereditary household in direct alliance with the ducal family. It is not a secretive order within the confines of the duchy, though there are many rumors regarding the upper echelons of its members. One not need practice magic to be a member &#8211; it has many lower order members that can detect and spy upon those who do practice.\n<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Motto: &#8220;<b>Security through information<\/b>.&#8221;<\/li>\n<li>Symbol: A White Pigeon on a diagonal red slash, leaning right and gripping a scroll.<\/li>\n<li>Periaptery: To denote the magus&#8217; initial training, a charm of iron and wood bearing wings wreathed in a chain is worn.<\/ki>\n<\/li>\n<p>Talismanen: To denote the continued association, a the periaptery has the Eye of Delleb inset into it.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Interactions_with_other_Occultists\"><\/span>Interactions with other Occultists<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Warclock, wizards, and occultists in general not affiliated with House Malor properly MUST inform the order &#8220;before they set foot&#8221; in Dunstrand. Nominally, it just means they must check in and inform the group of their intentions while in Dunstrand, not that they become a Minor Presence within the order. No arcane or occult research is allowed within Dunstrand that is not overseen by the order &#8211; including ruin exploration and item\/knowledge seeking. The exceptions are the Riverdans &#8211; which the order has only loose oversight in (much to their dismay). Independent wizards may operate their magical powers &#8220;at the forbearance of House Malor&#8221; &#8211; i.e. the order reserves the right to censure (shut down, inhibit, and even escort to the Duchy&#8217;s border if need be) the individual if they do not approve of their actions. The &#8220;fruits of any unsanctioned action may be forfeit by such wizards and their companions&#8221; in such cases. There is no absolute forbidden or allowed actions &#8211; and House Malor likes to keep it nebulous. Outside occultists can expect to have the order&#8217;s agents follow them for a while and at random intervals if they stay long. The order is known to use creatures &#8211; familiars and homonculus- extensively in this spying.\n<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Organization\"><\/span>Organization<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<div>Current Heads of House and Members:<\/div>\n<ol>\n<li>Head of the House<\/li>\n<li>Master\/Mistress of the House (x3)\n<ul>\n<li>Master of the Barque Chapel<\/li>\n<li>Master of Doves (Mailai)<\/li>\n<li>Master of Sceptres<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>Journeyman of the order (x7)\n<ul>\n<li>Chainforged Master: Oversees the making of the orders&#8217; mystical chains<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>Apprentice Arcane of the House (x9 to 15); Apprentices who have finished their initial training and pledged themselves to the order.<\/li>\n<li>Apprentice Servile of the Order (x11 to 22); These are magi in training.
