The order is officially maintained through local contributions and traditions in the eastern area of the Duchy of Fhayl in the Raolin Baronial capital city of Maycot. While not an actual order of Knights recognized by the High King, they organize themselves internally as an order, with the roots (the clergy\/political arm) and the branch (the military arm) run by two differing factions. A major stronghold of the Verdurine Order is called mother\u2019s house. A minor fort, the least of which has as few as one actual knight and a dozen or so brothers- and sisters-at- arms, is sister\u2019s house, while each great political center of the Order\u2014also its greatest fortresses\u2014is known as Grandmother\u2019s House. The order has long traditions in assisting the Order of Davros and its druidic sect. As such, it even attracts some of the Pine Tribesmen &#8211; the few remaining human nomads of the Pale Plains. As well as this, it is an open order &#8211; half elves and even elves are welcome. While no elves usually voluntarily join, several outcasts can be found in the history of the order &#8211; those seeking penance and absolution. These are often short lived members.<\/p>\n<p>Leadership: Verdames and Grensieurs<br \/>\nGrandmothers House: 1 (in the fortified city of Maycot)<br \/>\nMothers House: 3<br \/>\n&#8211; The original and still standing &#8220;She-Wolf&#8217;s Den&#8221; is a natural cavern, a sacred place and only a few senior members know of its location in the Fhaylen Marches<br \/>\nSisters House: 6<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Joining_the_Order\"><\/span>Joining the Order<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><b>Military\/&#8221;Branch&#8221;<\/b>: By tradition, a young squire is eligible to be &#8216;Tested&#8217; in their fourteenth, fifteenth, and sixteenth spring. (Those who join the Order as teens or adults instead face Testing in their first, second, and third spring after a full year as probationers.) Also by tradition, no one passes their first Testing. Exceptions have occurred, but each is legendary\u2026not always in a good way. Will, like most, does not become a passed-squire in his fourteenth spring. The &#8220;Testing&#8221; is different, and attended by a few senior members of the order &#8211; mostly the Root sect.<br \/>\nTime of Traveling as a knight-sabbatic<br \/>\nRANKS: <\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>First Spear, the senior battle-captain of the entire Order; <\/li>\n<li>knight-guidant<\/li>\n<li>squire-probationers<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"History_and_Anecdotes\"><\/span>History and Anecdotes<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>The Gaian sects often use euphemisms and ellipses (such as \u201ca green belt\u201d or \u201cthe green belts\u201d) to refer to the Verdurine Order. This is in small part a deliberate obfuscation\u2014those not in the know who overhear a chance remark will continue to be ignorant, in much the same way (though not to the same degree) that thieves\u2019 cant protects thieves. In larger part, it is simply that many in the Green Church are a bit squeamish about these hard-eyed killers\u2014each a more deadly predator than any wolf. <\/p>\n<div id=\"popmapsrlm\" class=\"hidden\"><a href=../../../../22/wp-content/uploads/srlm-map-handgif/index_1662929950.html><img src=../../../../22/wp-content/uploads/srlm-map-handgif/index_1662929950.html alt=\"Steel Realms Map\" lazyload \/><\/a><\/div><div class=\"modal fade\" id=\"basicModal\" tabindex=\"-1\" role=\"dialog\" aria-labelledby=\"basicModal\" aria-hidden=\"true\">\r\n    <div class=\"modal-dialog\">\r\n        <div class=\"modal-content\">\r\n            <div class=\"modal-header\">\r\n            <button type=\"button\" class=\"close\" data-dismiss=\"modal\" aria-hidden=\"true\">X<\/button>\r\n            <h4 class=\"modal-title\" id=\"myModalLabel\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Modal_title\"><\/span>Modal title<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\r\n            <\/div>\r\n            <div class=\"modal-body\" id=\"myModalPop\">\r\n            <\/div>\r\n    <\/div>\r\n  <\/div>\r\n<\/div><script>jQuery(\"a[class^='dndclass-cleric'],a[class*=' dndclass-cleric']\").prop(\"href\",\"\/characters\/class\/cleric\");jQuery(\"a[class^='dndclass-fighter'],a[class*=' dndclass-fighter']\").prop(\"href\",\"\/characters\/class\/fighter\");jQuery(\"a[class^='dndclass-ranger'],a[class*=' dndclass-ranger']\").prop(\"href\",\"\/characters\/class\/ranger\");jQuery(\"a[class^='dndclass-barbarian'],a[class*=' dndclass-barbarian']\").prop(\"href\",\"\/characters\/class\/barbarian\");jQuery(\"a[class^='dndclass-druid'],a[class*=' dndclass-druid']\").prop(\"href\",\"\/characters\/class\/druid\");<\/script>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Verdurine Order, sometimes known as the green knights (sometimes confused with the &#8220;green knights&#8221;\/Order of the Trident of Gwinn by commoners) is a sect of the organized Green Church in the southern heartlands of Gladnor.
