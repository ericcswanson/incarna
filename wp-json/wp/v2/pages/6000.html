She was part of a troup that performed for the goddess, in the merchant cities, at festivals. Meb rose up when his priesthood capitulated at Waeverly Rock in the Crou Invasion of the Pale Plains. Those who surrendered were tortured and the flock flayed alive by the mad priest Delcrou. Meb refused to surrender, instead becoming angry and turning against the wishes of the temple. Meb slew several of the followers as they cowered in fear \u2013 waiting for their turn to be sacrificed by the mad priest. Meb flew away, towards the hills and crashed into the mountainside when his wings failed. He awoke bereft of grace. Meb gave up on his ideals and became confidence man \u2013 scamming many unworthy souls. He adopted the faith of the fire goddess (<a href=../../../../22http/incarnanet/verse/set/steel-realms/divine/green/entity/merkaine/22_1932820256.html title=\"\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"\" class=\"\">Merkaine, goddess of fire<\/a>) on a whim. It was all a charade though &#8211; there were no powers other than his own celestial ones he used to hoodwink folk out of their money. After years of watching the region fall into war, a voice came from the flames of his campfire one night &#8211; the voice of the fire goddess. He felt his old passion swell, and game himself over to her service for real \u2013 as a means of trying to feel the grace he felt once again. He started among the poorest, and try though he might, he was not good at converting&#8230; his charlatan ways made his interaction hollow and many felt the dishonesty in his voice &#8211; making it difficult \u2013 self sabotaging almost for the will of a goddess so far distant from her core base of believers. Eventually he fell in as a sell-sword band named the Black Hounds, and began to convert many of the band to Merkaine\u2019s ways \u2013 \u201cThe Cleansing Flame\u201d being a natural ideology for those who burn, pillage and loot. Though that was his pitch, he grew to become more like a mascot. His charlatan ways made him easy to get along with, and he gave up converting them and began to fight along side of them for friendship and fellowship. He embraced his ways as a trickster, and in Poelitz, found an old shrine and scholar to Merkaine and pledged himself to the obscure Order of Depelia, also known as The Flickering Flame. His was a tepid ministry at best &#8211; though his tricks were useful when on missions with scouts. However, he became more fervent when the Black Hound, in service in Tarmysia, were part of a band that guarded captured Umbakian sailors. The Black Hound compound was used to hold prisoners &#8211; a place of rest for those rotating off the front lines of Gillman Pass. One of the prisoners mentioned he would trade his freedom for special knowledge. Of course they all say that, but that night a flame spoke to Meb in his dreams and told him to listen to this Umbakian. The Umbakian was a descendant of an old house, whose great-great-great grandfather was a Silver Talent knight. One of his co-kinghts confessed, on his death bed, knowledge that had been handed down from generations of his ancestors. The last of some order of fire knights in beast scale had been hunted down and executed near &#8216;the red shore&#8217; near the lake of the smallfoot&#8217;s rum barrel floats. As close as he can tell, this may be one of the Hearth Guardians scale armor &#8211; The guardians were a sacred band operating out of Northgate Garrison, in service to Merkaine. The last of them left the wall in CY 7200. It is unknown what the fate of them was exactly, but one of their Lt&#8217;s was named Azrudur who was seen in north Umbak. He was supposedly killed by the Silver Talent knights. The Silver Talents tried to wear it, but it caused them distress and burned the squire. It is said they cast it into one of the rivers of southern Dunstrand &#8211; the earlmdom of Bar-Innis. This seemed to confirm the legends of a lost order of Merkaine. Meb has seen all the actions since then &#8211; the fall of the Black Hounds, his journey with the Gallants, and the travel to Crestwold all point to divine guidance to this sacred relic. Now it is up to him. <\/p>\n<p>Personality > Ive spent so long in the temple that i have little practical experience in dealing with people of the outside world.<br \/>\nIdeal > CHANGE &#8211; We must help bring about the changes the gods are consistently working in the world<br \/>\nBond > RELIC &#8211; I would die to recover an ancient relic of my faith that was lost long ago.<br \/>\nFlaw > I am suspicious of strangers and expect the worst of them. <\/p>\n<p>How they got the name: Their handshake is floppy and weak like a dying fish.<br \/>\nTime in the Black Hounds: {4 years}<br \/>\n\u2013 Last rank was Lt.<br \/>\nWhat are they known for > Not for healing, more for being a mascot.

Fish entered into a deal with House Malor to witness and keep his friend Pops safe while the mages brotherhood attempted to restore his memory. They met in secret under a curio shop in Torrelsons Ford. There were 3 members of House Malor, 2 bodyguards, Fish and Pops. House Malor disarmed Pops (like that would do anything), put him in a circle of protection, and had him drink from the Rosewood Vase. It took only a few moments, and then all hell broke loose. First, House Malor sensed something because they started to attack Pops. Fish defended him, and took out one of the bodyguards. In the battle, Pops killed another of the bodyguards, one of the mages, and when his guard was down, Fish as well. Stabbed him in the back as they were trying to leave. They discovered a tunnel that lead to the river water and Fish was killed as they were both wading in. He was killed with glee by Pops. When Pops waded in, Fish grabbed on to him and would not let go. Instead of being carried out by the current, Pops drowned with the dead weight of Fish clinging onto him. But Pops lived, apparently saved by Elancil at the cost of more of his memory.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Character Name: Meb Old Black Hound Nickname: &#8220;Fish&#8221; Description: male (adrogyn), age: 27 (160 max), Aisimar (fallen), left handed, bald, brown-yellow eyes CLASS: PRIEST (2nd; = ANGELIC GUIDE; Trickster Domain) Hit Points: 5, 5 +0 = 10 Strength 11 {} Intelligence 12 {} Wisdom 17 { +3 } Dexterity 13 { +1 } Constitution 11 [&hellip;]<\/p>\n<a role=\"link\" class=\"rtp-readmore\" title=\"Read more on Meb (&#8220;Fish&#8221;)\" href=../../../../22http/incarnanet/host/rocky/characters/meb/22_2053375260.html rel=\"nofollow\">Read More \u2192<\/a>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"parent":3513,"menu_order":15,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":[],"categories":[],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/6000"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=6000"}],"version-history":[{"count":12,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/6000\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":7086,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/6000\/revisions\/7086"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/3513"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=6000"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=6000"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=6000"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
