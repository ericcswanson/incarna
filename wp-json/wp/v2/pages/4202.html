One was a node at the top of the falls, a dangerous one that was betimes corrupted by the light of the Interloper. This was the only node that the world at large knows about (and part of the reason the monastery was there &#8211; to keep an eye on it). Another the found at the trade station of Southdrift, called Horizvhal in those days. The third one was in Creb-Neverood and was the cause for the doom that found it when the Winterhost corrupted it.<br \/>\nIn Creb Nevarood was their test for the Iron Fists; they were pit against the sisters of Mercy of Aerna. The sisters provided unflinching targets and when an accident happened, and the acolyte failed a test, there was no animosity or thought of impropriety. Once the monastery was lost, the way fo the Iron First went with it. These monks also had Channel Divinity. <\/p>\n<h4><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Ruins_of_Doinesh\"><\/span>Ruins of Doinesh<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n<p>Doniesh in the Hinterlands was a center for learning and the faith for the Monks of Doinesh. The Monks were Ikribu Light Worshipers, renowned for their monastic traditions practicing a new idea of &#8220;natural&#8221; fighting and channeling their inner power. Doniesh fell, as did the north, when the Winterhost of the Lich Lords rose and took the once proud Dundarian Kingingdom. It was sacred to them because they had found an animist fount of light at the top of the Emerald Falls, then called the Evenrude Falls. It was dangerous though, and on some nights sacred tot he unholy trio its power could be correupted &#8211; and so the oversaw it as their duty to oversee the fount. <\/p>\n<div class=\"container-fluid\">Regional: <\/p>\n<div class=\"row\">\n<h2 id=\"history\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"History\"><\/span><i class=\"fa fa-book\"><\/i> History<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<div class=\"flat\">Knowledge broken down by ease of discovery\/prominence.<\/div><ul class=\"nav nav-tabs\">\r\n<li class=\"active\"><a data-toggle=\"tab\" href=../../../../22_842147072.html><i class=\"fa fa-key\"><\/i> Common<\/a><\/li>\r\n<li><a data-toggle=\"tab\" href=../../../../22_842147072.html><i class=\"fa fa-unlock\"><\/i> Uncommon<\/a><\/li>\r\n<li><a data-toggle=\"tab\" href=../../../../22_842147072.html><i class=\"fa fa-unlock-alt\"><\/i> Rare<\/a><\/li>\r\n<li title=\"Knowledge that is difficult to come by.
