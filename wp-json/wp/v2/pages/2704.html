Besides, <a href=../../../../22/iweb/host/marcc/chars/Beeddel/index_756892176.html>Beeddel<\/a> is well liked there for seeing the spirit of the woods.<br \/>\n    They are temporarily taken into the employ of the Duke&#8217;s Honor Guards, with Belim having the rank of Corporal. After a couple months (9142, Month 5, Day 24), they are released from service as the cost of the honor guard is being shifted toward regular soldiers.<br \/>\n    They are released the same day with a young man named <a href=../../../../22/iweb/host/kelly/rpgs/_chars/BillClay/index_2052077126.html>Bill Clay<\/a>, just come from<br \/>\n    the western reaches of Dunstrand and the war there.

War, strife and famine abound and all begin to fear they may be pressed into a force the Duke is raising to defend the western lands of his duchy.<br \/>\n    Then they are introduced to sira Goll Saren on 9142, Month 5, Day 30, a merchant&#8217;s aide and a representative of &#8216;certain powers&#8217; who have an interest in<br \/>\n    the struggle for power in Dunstrand. Goll tells them he would like to hire them for a task, a research task.<br \/>\n    Belim, Bill, and Beedel were busy waiting for Goll Sarens&#8217; summons to meet with the researcher when they discover Gellwin.<br \/>\n    They are out scouring the armories for good prices when Belim recognizes the halfling from his hair color in a crowd.<br \/>\n    Surprised and happy, they all reire to a local tavern to catch up. Prior to their meeting with sira Goll, Belim sends word of a new addition to his &#8216;crew&#8217; that Goll must include in the hiring.<br \/>\n    Goll introduces them to <a href=../../../../22/iweb/host/seand/chars/Grumwell/index_1041377811.html>Grumwell<\/a>, a scribe (though the man is nearly 2m and a massive body suited more for war with a balde than a pen) and says that together they will be traveling to southern Dunstrand to<br \/>\n    perform this task &#8211; should they accept. As to why a scholar needs protection &#8211; well, he says that certain parties may not be happy with the outcome of the research.<br \/>\n    Sira Goll says only that he works for the Shady Rock Merchants (part of a larger allied group or merchants called The Surefoot Merchant Coster), and that with war and all the uncertainty that been brought to Dusntrand, his masters<br \/>\n    want to be able to take advantage of whichever way the wind blows, and need more information to do it.<br \/>\n    Specifically, they want you to research the blood lines of the ancient Riverdan houses and trace all of them to as far as possible. <a href=../../../../22/iweb/host/seand/chars/Grumwell/index_1041377811.html>Grumwell<\/a><br \/>\n    says that a couple are said to be fallow &#8211; their line ended long ago.

Pekki pitches his deal, 200 silvers a month, healing, equipment replacement &#8211; he even claims that it may take a year (which we were all interested in &#8211; more silver). We excused ourselves to talk about the deal away from the stables and prying eyes of our potential employer.<br \/>\n    They have given us a strange ring, so that their affiliates along the way will know us as allies and aid us &#8211; a ring with some sort of raised, black lizard on it. We talk over our fears; &#8216;certain parties&#8217;, and &#8216;certain powers&#8217; always scare us&#8230;we really don&#8217;t know who we are dealing with. On the other hand, we&#8217;ve all been given a bonus of 100 silvers without doing a single thing. We confirmed our desire to work on the research project after meeting Grumwell and discussing it. Pekki seemed please and said we should contact Grak with all issues. Grak gave us a list of all the place in the &#8216;dans where we can find shops and persons part of the Surefoot Merchant Coster which could reimburse us, re-supply us, and help with healing. Its about 1 place in every other &#8216;dan territory, and widely varied in their business (smith, crofter, etc.). We were told to talk to the locals for any supplies we may need. Belim haggled down the cost to nothing in a few cases, but the most we paid was half price for any goods. Don helped us find a bed and we vowed to set off the next day.\n<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"bs\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Phony_Statues_of_the_White_Sisters\"><\/span>Phony Statues of the White Sisters<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>\n    [&#8211; <b>Play Scenario Reference:<\/b> <a href=../../../../22/iweb/host/kelly/i/set/srlm/play/c_ancbld/Fony/22_1480275504.html>Aiding the White Sisters<\/a> &#8211;}\n<\/p>\n<p>\n    9142, Month 6, Day 5; Before we left, Pekki brought us into his office and said there was something we could do for him. Apparently he &#8216;knew someone&#8217; that was having problems locally. The church of Aerna was having its authority undermined and losing money to counterfeit statues. The White Sisters&#8217;s work was being cranked out and passed as the real deal. At first it was annoying and but then the industry grew. Over the last few months, they have investigated and narrowed it down to one area of the city they think its coming from&#8230; and the reward is 400 silvers &#8211; plus healing and re-supply. WE agreed, as there seemed to be hints that it would be a short job.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n    Turns out, the short duration is due to the fact that people who go investigating are usually &#8216;taken care of&#8217; in about 2-3 days. They&#8217;ve spent months collecting information, zeroing in on the culprits, but its cost a dozen dead and more wounded. There&#8217;s 6 candidates for the culprits, and they all live in or near Mandarn&#8217;s Cross (called &#8216;mans cross by the locals). It ranges from houses, apartments, and even one shop. The addresses where the only thing turned in by the last scout they sent into the area.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n    The first thing we tried was the bait method &#8211; we posed as people coming late to market weekend wanting to buy a statue.

Maybe i can &#8216;Mist&#8217; up a couple of you if we know<br \/>\n    we are going to get shot at; that would give incoming missiles a severe disadvantage.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n    [Belim] Trying to make the whole run to the city in the dark, and beat<br \/>\n    up, seems like a bad idea; however, we are not staying right here. We seem<br \/>\n    to have been spat out the back door of a very bad place, and I am not going<br \/>\n    to stand around waiting for those snake people (or any of the other uglies in there)<br \/>\n    to figure out how to follow us out. So I say we put about a mile between<br \/>\n    us and this place and find a good lie-up point where we can see back (and<br \/>\n    around) as much as possible. A low hilltop or something would be great.<br \/>\n    Do we have any moonlight? (I&#8217;m not in too bad condition right now &#8211; some<br \/>\n    healing cuts and bruises, but nothing debilitating.)\n<\/p>\n<p>\n    [Grumwell] sounds like a good plan. I&#8217;m in.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n    [Bill] With full moonlight, lets send Beedell out to see if we can find a<br \/>\n    copse of trees or something. We have nobody with any outdoor skills&#8230;\n<\/p>\n<p>\n    [Beeddel] You know, i&#8217;ve been watching and thinking on a lot of this stuff, and i think i can figure out our direction&#8230;.<br \/>\n    at least keep us out of the effect. I&#8217;ve been paying close attention to which way we were going and i<br \/>\n    think i&#8217;m begining to get the hang of orienting us.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n    Beeddel leads the group out of the gullies on the far side of the hill between us and Applebottom farm. At the very least, he does not allow us to get back into the effect zone, and finds an obvious copse of trees to picket the animals and set up watch against&#8230;<br \/>\n    No fires, though you do make a bunch of noise as you are hurt and tired, but no one jumps you or tries to attack you during the night.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n    [Grumwell] I have a few more 1 point poultices that can be used for healing<br \/>\n    checks for those that are down.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n    [Bill] I&#8217;m willing to burn through any mundane healing we got, as any<br \/>\n    brigand weapon can drop me with an average hit. This does obviously<br \/>\n    point to the need for even some leather armor possibly when we get to<br \/>\n    Tadeus&#8230; but i am not sure i can hold my shield and wear armor<br \/>\n    without being slowed down. I&#8217;ve been really trying to focus on being a better defender &#8211;<br \/>\n    i&#8217;m just not a warrior like some of you, but I can be a shield-man. Some day i&#8217;m gonna retire from this life and get my own farm.<br \/>\n    Animals and plants, farming and markets&#8230; i gotta stay focussed on learning that too.<br \/>\n    Maybe i even want to be an animal doctor. I gotta get some sort of really light<br \/>\n    armor too &#8211; for when the blows that i can&#8217;t defend come through.<br \/>\n    Something that won&#8217;t drag me down&#8230;\n<\/p>\n<p>\n    We all discussed it and agreed to wait until light to move. Vraxen complained of a soreness in his back, and we all thought nothing of it until morning, when we found immobile. Bill checked him and we found a tiny needle where his soreness started \u2013 a minute dart with a serpent design carved on it. Perhaps the serpent people had gotten to us after all. Beeddel scouted the path back to the road. In  the distance, coming from the east was a solitary traveler. We decided to seek what news we could and travel in larger numbers&#8230; we were not sure that the peddlers Jim and Jack, and their possible ally &#8216;Pete&#8217; may not be waiting for us out there.\n<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"The_Coming_of_Horace\"><\/span>The Coming of Horace<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>\n    9142, Month 6, Day 16; The traveler turned out to be a man named Horace, called &#8216;Ace&#8217;, from Dunstrand City. He had been sent by Pekki to aid us. Apparently Pekki took care of his family while he was away, and he had returned to the city and Pekki sent him to help. He makes no mention of Grak, Bill suspects him of not telling the whole truth, and by the looks of the rest of the party, they all agree. Oh well, we all have something to hide. Ace claims to be an information man and scout&#8230; he&#8217;s a &#8216;city scoundrel&#8217; says Bill. Beeddel says thats alright, since he&#8217;s preferring the air outdoors to the life in the city, perhaps we can use someone who is more skilled in an urban environment. He also brings word to avoid Applebottom Farm \u2013 a bit late. At first most of the party is upset, then we all have a laugh. At least we know he&#8217;s not with the peddlars. All is well and we set out for a 2 hour trip to the city.\n<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Ambushed_by_Steele_Eyed_Pete\"><\/span>Ambushed by Steele Eyed Pete<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>\n    After we travel for about 30 minutes and a large wolf-dog darts out from the underbrush and spooks the mounts, snarling and barking. Belim is not able to get his buckler in time, and Grumwell&#8217;s mount makes of with his crossbow. A group of 5 men rush us as we try and prepare for attack and Belim fires his crossbow while Beeddel snaps off a shot with his long bow \u2013 our foes cover the distance quick and we find ourselves in combat. For bandits, they are well organized. One, the leader, faces off against Belim with a broadsword, another 2 have short baldes and the last 2 turn out of be the peddlers Jim and Jack. Ace and Beeddel each fight 2 foes, one of them armored on each of them. Bill is stuck trying to control his mount while the wolf dog attacks the horse he on. During the course of combat, Grumwell enshrouds the half wolf in flames, causing it to run away, and allows Bill to unmount and enter the fight. Both Beeddel and Ace manage to hold their own, but things are not going well \u2013 three of our foes have leather armor and good weapons \u2013 hardly bandits in the normal sense. Belim and the leader with the sword square off in a match of blade on blade. A dizzying exchange is made with neither gaining the upper hand. Nearly a minute of full combat passes before our first foe is fallen. Grumwell climbs atop the rocks that held our foes from view and surveys the scene. An arrow flies from the distance as the hunter Steed attempts to take out our wizard. Grumwell decides that its too risky to be the only target out of combat, and with no skill launches himself upon the man fighting Belim, catching him by surprise and drives a dagger strait into his skull. They both tumble down in a heap. Over the next 30 seconds, Belim rushes the archer while Bill enters combat, turning the tide and the foes are whittled away. Though Belim shouts for captive, in the heat of battle and without coordination all our foes are downed \u2013 except Steed the hunter whom we take captive.\n<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Steed_the_Hunter_and_Pete%E2%80%99s_Lair\"><\/span>Steed the Hunter and Pete&#8217;s Lair<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>\n    We take a few moments, move off the trail, bind our wounds and discuss what to do next. Steed offers information of value to us and to lead us to the groups hideout. He says he is a hunter and only fell in when times got rough. We discovered that we had killed Steel Eyed Pete \u2013 a local ruffian and highwayman. We agree to the deal with Steed, and he tells us we can collect a bounty for Pete, and that he got the sword recently and has been acquiring the armor and weapons over a period of time \u2013 some before Steed joined. The marks on the blades all indicated they were made in the Merchant Cities \u2013 north of Dunstrand. Steed leads us to the cave, about 4 hours away. Beedel and Bill stay with the animals while the rest and Steed (who we force to go first) go into the cave. Apparently Pete did not tell Steed everything, as the trap and collapse kills Steed and seals the rest of the party in for three days. However, we do manage to get hundreds of silvers in goods and treasure. Belim, Ace and Grumwell found a keg of brandy and managed to drink it during the three days \u2013 who knows how much that was worth.\n<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Tadeus_%E2%80%93_Sir_Stuart_and_Rom%E2%80%99s_Mount\"><\/span>Tadeus &#8211; Sir Stuart and Rom&#8217;s Mount<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>\n    9142, Month 6, Day 16; We make our way to Tadeus, There we make contact with the Darrow Brothers Crofters and Pekki&#8217;s agents. We tell them everything so far and get a night of rest. The next day we find quarters at the Goats Blood Inn, inside a section of the city called Rams Gate. The old city was never finished, and the dilapidated keep reflects this. We get another night of rest while learning the lay of the land. We then try and talk to the Oighnan family \u2013 the rulers of the fief of Belmain. We are told that without an appointment, it will be 2 days before Sir Stuart will see us. We bathe and heal, learning more about the city. Sir Stuart believes our story of searching for a relative married into nobility ages ago. He tells us of the sorrowful times the Riverdans have come on. He does indicate we are in luck though,as full genealogy records exist \u2013 but these are all from memory and copies. However, in the ancient family crypts of the old capital of Gnedfort City, the noble families would bury their people with stone tablets citing ancestry. The families often intermingled, so any family tomb could be a wealth of information \u2013 rubbings can verify some key points of the genealogy copies, so it should be enough to legally serve as evidence. However, Gendfort is a city of the dead and the locals, who have made peace with their dead ancestors, will not appreciate us stirring up trouble. Because Grumwell is of the &#8216;dans and noble, Sir Stuart says that he trusts him. As long as no desecration is done, a few rubbings of bloodline tablets is not something Sir Stuart would worry over. He mentions Rom&#8217;s Mount as the place to search for the ancient crypts.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n    9142, Month 7, Day 4; Deciding that wounded is no way to go into this, we decide to hire a healer and spend 2 weeks healing up. We live well, Beeddel trains with a local hunter to improve his survival and Ace learns more of the city while Belim gets us a crude map of the region. All together we discover a lot of information. We have to leave Vraxen Pax in the care of the Darrow Brothers for the time we are in the city \u2013 he seems to have gone into some sort of comma (so the healer says). What we find out is very interesting.<br \/>\n    Gnedfort was THE shinning gem of the Riverdans. It was the largest of the cities in all the &#8216;dans, supporting a population of 40,000. It had three hills, one of which was dug out at one end for the Temple of The Earth &#8211; A holy place to the followers of Darupet. On Rom&#8217;s Mount was a tin mine and a small quarry. Haldor&#8217;s Hall was a craggy mount, entered through a tunnel going beneath the hill, and held the houses of many rich and on top of which stood the Fire of Pexmuth &#8211; a small keep, built by Pexmuth Oihgnan as a watch tower with its ever-burning fire which was a symbol of protection to the people. The ancient city was devastated by the river course change. Some of the ancient buildings on the rises and hills survived, and for a time levies and dams channeled the river&#8230; but ultimately it was ruined. When the levies broke, many were drowned. It is now a city of spirits, and it is said the dead walk there. Few who venture into its environs come out again. Annually at the spring festival, the clergy of Ezrilus holds a vigil to keep that which is dead barred from the fields and homes of the living in the areas around it. The locals do not appreciate anyone disturbing the peace they have made with their dead ancestors.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n    Rom&#8217;s Mount was named after Erwilla Rom, the first priestess of Darupet and the family priest of the founders. The great Temple of The Earth had its foundation laid in her time, mostly due to her efforts. The mount is a rock hill which had its south side washed away &#8211; it was mostly earthen. The family burial crypts were all carved into the mount. It is said the under the mount was an entrance to The Deeping. For many years these crypts stood locked and watched, opened only at times for burial.<br \/>\n    The mount was also a place where public processions were guided over &#8211; into its shadow for mourning or onto its plateau into the sun for celebrations. The tunnels flooded and crypts were ruined by the river, though damage was minimal compared to the rest of the city. A few crypts are visible from a distance &#8211; boulders of a different color marking their sealed entrances. It is said though that there are other crypts and pitfalls into the caverns that are merely covered by overgrowth. The is where most of the treasure-seekers go.\n<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Exploring_Rom%E2%80%99s_Mount\"><\/span>Exploring Rom&#8217;s Mount<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>\n    9142, Month 7, Day 6; We travel to Terrovere, a small village east of Gnedfort. The locals all get silent when we enter the only inn. We stay a night, keeping our ears open, but we learn nothing new. We tell the locals we are on out way to Malby. We try and scout to make sure we are not followed, and Beeddel hides our trails when we go off the road. We find a place to picket the horse in the rolling grasslands without being seen. We slowly approach Rom&#8217;s Mount. During our approach we are all subjected the The Suffering Tread \u2013 a manifestation of The Deeping where it seems as if a giant is about to tread on us. Wind sucked out of our lungs, panic in our throats, and a great weight descends. A few of us are unable or unwilling to back down, and though the ground drops in fornt of us, and vertigo makes us swoon, the 2 caught in the effect muster the will to resist. It leaves us with a sense of vertigo for a moment, and leaves no physical evidence of any kind.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n    As we approach, cold winds start blowing over us, and we hear the sounds of riots, screaming, horse hooves and the smell of death. Something horrible, in addition to the river flooding and killing thousands, went on here. All of us are on edge, our sanity is beginning to fray, but we manage to circle the mount to be out of sight, and come round to the earth temple. Deciding that the earth temple is the easiest way, we make our way up the rubble pile inside. Our best climbers are assailed by cold blasts, treacherous footing, fetid scents, and sink holes that tried to pull us under. Beedel made his way up to Cairn Top and scouted a bent iron we saw growing from the undergrowth \u2013 a family tomb entrance. The rest of the party made it up, with Ace&#8217;s escort for us all in case we fell. We bent back the bars enough for the average size characters to squeeze in and began to explore. There were traps enough for the unwary, including a collapsing ceiling, flooded chamber, and 2 armored, skeletal guards. The whole system consisted of a entry, a receiving chamber, columbarium, crypt proper, chapel, supply area, reliquary, and a whole set of flooded chambers over 120 feet deep that we surmised may be drained by some operation in the earth temple. The crypt of family Crithomyssis remained an enigma until we finally discovered the concealed door and lured away the armored skeletons. The stone tablets of genealogy we were seeking were found in the reliquary they guarded. We took our rubbings and got out, though one of them struck at Belim as he crawled out, a deep gash into his leg. Grumwell examined them and declared that he remembered a text he had read in the Oighnan family records in Tadeus \u2013 we had the proof we needed.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n    We endured the trip back down the hill While Beeddel scouted from above \u2013 spotting a pair of men making their way to our mounts picket line. He hurried back, suffering the horrific visions, smells and dangerous conditions as best we could. Many times we felt pursued by some unknown force, and could not shake the sightings at the edges of our vision. Beeddel and Ace went ahead and captured the 2 men, who claimed to have long ago sent word to town. We discussed what to do, but before long our decision was made for us by the sound of an angry mob &#8211; the locals were not taking kindly to our trek into the dead city. Apparently some hunter from the village saw us go into the ruins and found our picket. We began to saddle up and prepare to move out when that giant&#8217;s tread sound came out of nowhere, rushing in and scattering our mounts and us alike. Belim and Beddel managed to avoid its affect, and when the rest of us, including our captives, were pulled into the effect they tried to pull us out as the ground vanished beneath our feet \u2013 succeeding only in securing themselves to us to join us as we feel. Feel is perhaps the wrong word, sunk into the earth and through it, without touching anything is what happened. After a great feeling of sickness and nausea we were deposited unceremoniously in some vast cavern, in the dark. A horrendous sense of vertigo could only mean we had been pulled into The Deeping \u2013 the dark mother&#8217;s veins. Some of us retched, and the 2 hunters began to scream \u2013 attracting the attention of whatever may dwell in the caverns. In the dark, we spoke in whispers, contemplating what to do next.\n<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Vraxen_Follows\"><\/span>Vraxen Follows<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>\n    <strong>Vraxen Returns<\/strong> &#8211; Vraxen had been following, trying to catch up to the group after doing some scouting in the local towns.<br \/>\n    Too late he discovered the group would provoke the wrath to such a degree by where they were going. He managed to<br \/>\n    discover some of the locales were preparing a &#8216;welcome&#8217; and eventually wandered in at the last second, to watch the Suffering Tread&#8217;s<br \/>\n    effect of bending space and pulling the hunters in ambush and the rest of the group into its effect.<br \/>\n    Terrified, but fearing for his companions, he examines the area where he last saw them.

Cattle raid aside (and we were hoping to avoid bloodshed on that one) our characters have been<br \/>\n    pretty much on the &#8216;good&#8217; track, if not quite saintly knights, which would be my preference. &#8220;Focus on our mission, try not to hurt anybody ain&#8217;t got it coming to them, no mercy for anybody does got it coming to them&#8221;. There&#8217;s your mission statement for the simpletons.<br \/>\n    When quizzed about our name (as a group) we didn&#8217;t have any answer except the casually dropped &#8216;Miserable Bastards&#8217;. Not really suited for noble courts and priestesses is it? I think we should have something cooler sounding, although I&#8217;m not full of good ideas.<br \/>\n    Something not pretentious &#8211; that&#8217;s for sure &#8211; the &#8216;Black Company&#8217; would be right out. &#8216;Lords of the Riverdans&#8217;? Nyuk.<br \/>\n    As for the decision making process in the group, it&#8217;s always been that me making the battlefield decisions where there wasn&#8217;t time for deliberation; but when there was time for a consensus was always made by a group decision (as quickly as we could). I think that was a good method.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n    Jiles: I agree. I would second the notion of being basically&#8230; well, ahem, &#8216;good&#8217;. I would even go farther and say it may means sometimes we are on the other side of the law. There&#8217;s the<br \/>\n    greater good of what we are doing too &#8211; I am a patriot of the Riverdans (all underdogs really; courage being his faith!) and if there&#8217;s coming political change and these geneologies will help that<br \/>\n    cause he is all for it &#8211; so be it if we have to step on a few toes. Belim has had previous service and seems to be the leader in all things by default. I think we definitely need someone we all<br \/>\n    acknowledge when we are paralyzed with indecision or need to cut through concensus. I&#8217;m open to anyone in the group leading, each has different qualifications &#8211; Horace has definitely been around and seen<br \/>\n    a lot more things, Beedel&#8217;s got the spirit of Dunstrand with him, and Grumwell is by far the smartest amongst us. I am intent on increasing social skills &#8211; persuade, CHA and such and trying to use<br \/>\n    his faith connections to move the party ahead as a right hand man sort. Position him as the guy who goes into town and can calm the locals, put a good face on the group, arrange for services and such.<br \/>\n    Though its cliche, i&#8217;ll focus on healing too so the rest of you dont have to beyond whats already there. As for a name, the &#8220;Bondeuchebags&#8221; is probably out. Our goal is to range across the entire Riverdans ferreting out this information &#8211; how<br \/>\n    about Belim&#8217;s Rangers?\n<\/p>\n<p>\n    Belim: I have to say I&#8217;m kinda not down with attaching a character&#8217;s name to the group. Characters die sometimes (and the tooth fairy isn&#8217;t real &#8211; sorry); and something more poetical might create a little more mystique (and we need all we can get); and<br \/>\n    I&#8217;m not the kind of guy that would want his name out there like a big bullseye (or bigger than it already is).

Hayden&#8217;s pumice armor saved our sorry butts more times than I can count.<br \/>\n    <br \/>&#8211; The elves called us &#8216;friends&#8217;, and we can ask them for help in the future.<br \/>\n    <br \/>&#8211; We made our way to Zerburre (a decent sized town at last), heard about some religious troubles along the way, and never let on anything about what we had seen or done. Which brings me to some thoughts:<br \/>\n    <br \/>* Unless the party feels otherwise, I think we should stay under the radar: no insignia, no group name, no confirm\/deny on our activities. That said, confirming rumors about a nameless party of unknowns, and exaggerating their exploits somewhat, can&#8217;t hurt (for now at least.) The completely unknown is a hell of a lot scarier than everyone knowing it&#8217;s just us schlubs. We&#8217;ll stick to our mundane cover stories for now.<br \/>\n    <br \/>* That means the local noble we may soon be working with needs to keep us anonymous too. Especially if we get mixed up in religious conflicts; I&#8217;m tempted to say we should get some &#8216;ninja masks&#8217; for when we do the real dirty work.<br \/>\n    <br \/>* On a different tangent, I&#8217;d like to make a small shift with Belim: I&#8217;ll say that in the moment when he was flying through the air&#8211;between getting his chest stove in by the elf and bashing his head on the street and passing out&#8211;he had a bit of a realization that he isn&#8217;t the best suited to act the heavy fighter. While &#8220;Fortune Favors the Bold&#8221; and &#8220;Forward! Forward! Forward!&#8221; are good in principle, they don&#8217;t always work out great on a personal level. So I want to have him retain that attitude tactically, but take a better thought out approach overall (call it &#8216;maturing&#8217;). That is to say: work on the leadership skills to make the group work better as a combat team. I&#8217;ll have to request the GM&#8217;s help, since I don&#8217;t know the rules and skills from bupkis; but I currently have Leadership(1), Unit Tactics(1?), Persuade(2), Military Lore(3?), Combat Leadership(0 &#8211; working on that one after one more level of Lore), so there is some leadership potential there. After the last adventure we have some individual CP and some &#8216;group&#8217; CP to be used however is most beneficial; we&#8217;ll need to sort that. Maybe there are some officers in the Zerburre garrison and books in the noble&#8217;s library that can help me out with training.<br \/>\n    <br \/>&#8211; Next tangent: reconnoitering towns as we arrive, such as Zerburre where we just got to. The splitting up to get the lay of the land (where are the inns, garrisons, good\/bad neighborhoods, markets, merchants, etc.?) worked well. If we have the standard group of 6 again, maybe it goes like this: In safer towns, 3 groups of 2 with a streetwise\/urban-survival character in each; in a shadier town, 2 groups of 3, same skill division; and I suppose in a totally hostile area we just stay in one group.<br \/>\n    <br \/>&#8211; We have either a couple days or a couple weeks in Zerburre before we take on the religious conflict &#8211; if we choose to do that. We&#8217;re having a dinner with the noble to discuss the details of that; let&#8217;s just make sure we don&#8217;t alienate the wrong religion. In the meantime, for what it&#8217;s worth, Belim will be having a hammer commissioned (roughly in these dimensions but not decorated: http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/File:Polish_Horseman%27s_picks_from_XVII_century.PNG), repairing and refitting, and generally relaxing and chatting up the local female populace. As should you all; I mean, what else would a bunch of young guys who&#8217;ve been stuck in combat and sleeping on the ground for weeks do?<\/p>\n<p>Belim, Son if Hardivan<br \/>\n    <br \/>Queens Own Tonbridge Dragoons (inactive)\n<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Balthazaars_Fire\"><\/span>Balthazaars Fire<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Along the way, the party comes across a church to Balthazaar! the Lightbringers have no place in the Riverdans usually. A closer inspection reveals it to be a church of the Wyld Faith at one time, but its obviously been converted. The crossroads is Terbans Cross. There is the church, a small stable and an Inn. the Inn proudly displays the signs of Gaia &#8211; and tensions are apparent. Perhaps this is some of the religious conflict you have heard about. <\/p>\n<p>The party has <a href=../../../../22/host/sean-drew/chars/rabat/22_761336655.html>Rabat<\/a> join them in seeking out highwaymen &#8211; he is the messenger that the Lightbringers use to get the party&#8217;s attention. Horun is sent by the faction of Gaia to represent &#8211; there is strife in the party, but Belim keeps everything under control. Balthazaar is pleased that trade is restored. The Flame of Balthazaar was restored to the temple, but Rabat accidentally handled it. It drained him forever, but gave him the light of wonderment!\n<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Samedi_Leaves\"><\/span>Samedi Leaves<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Samedi has spent the last couple days on the road healing the group as much as he could. He excuses himself to think while the group makes plan for securing an audience and stowing gear in preparation for entering the castle grounds ahead. Belim gathers the group outside of the castle to make sure everyone is one the same page. Samedi announces that he feels it is time that he make a sojourn to the woodlands &#8211; he is not sure when he will return. He must commune with the beast lord to make sure the path he is on is the right one. given the open hostility between his Wyld faith and that of the Lightbringers growing in this area, he thinks it best to seek out his path before the party is seen to take sides ahead of time. He wishes Belim and his crew the best, and hopes to see them again. &#8220;Who knows that the best lord has in store for me!?&#8221; he says. &#8220;But for you, i see strange things\u2026 unnatural things. Where you go, the best lord\u2019s gaze is hazy&#8230; just know that the moon is your friend while you are there &#8211; her light does more than illuminate!&#8221;\n<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Coming_to_Zerburre\"><\/span>Coming to Zerburre<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>One of the first things you notice is the strong Lightbringer presence &#8211; totally out of the normal for the Riverdans. A well wishing from Aerna stands inscribed above a gatehouse to the city. It is also the first walled city you have seen in the Riverdans. It was obviously once a majestic city\u2026 and although it would be highly defensible, only 2 guards now stand at the gate and none seem to man the walls themselves. They stop you and asked the business of armed strangers.\n<\/p>\n<p>You state you are seeking the Burren clan family, you are pointed to the obvious castle at the highest point in the city &#8211; what seems to be a man-made hill upon which an old but solid keep stands. The soldiers pay proper respects to those proper followers of Lightbringers faith \u2013 even a nod to those not their own. The guards make sure you understand that there is a iron rule of law. Keep your bows unstrung and weapons sheathed at all times \u2013 no bare blades under order of the marshall except to defend your life under similar attack. Violence is unwelcome here. Prayer time for those following The Light is at the cathedral in the morning (as they tell you this, as if on cue, bells ring faintly).\n<\/p>\n<p>From the courtyard, the town seems overly quiet. There is not the normal bustle you would associate with a town that can hold a few thousand. The people look at you and make little eye contact. Its obvious that sanitation is a low priority &#8211; probably for a few years now.\n<\/p>\n<p>Scanning around, you spot the pair of Ace and Vraxen. Both appear to be in good spirits, and are gaming with some off-duty guards in the courtyard, outside the stables. Even from this distance, you can see Vraxen drop a card behind his back and Ace steps on it &#8211; out of site from the guardsmen. It seems the antics of those who once traveled with you have not changed\u2026 you sigh heavily and shout their names. Ace drops to \u201ctie his laces\u201d, picking up the card, and Vraxen claims a win! Alas, as you draw closer, you discover that even cheating was not enough &#8211; Vraxen has lost again. Smiling and with arms outstretched you reacquaint yourselves. Seems that fortune has brought you together again.\n<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Rivin%E2%80%99s_Hedge_Maze_(the_Feywild)\"><\/span>Rivin&#8217;s Hedge Maze (the Feywild)<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"The_Crystal_Noose\"><\/span>The Crystal Noose<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Though your sojourn in the Feywild took no time in this world, it did not leave you without effect. Some may have tried to get a couple more hours sleep after your wee-early-hours return to this plane, but largely failed. Shortly after dawn you\u2019ve all given up on sleep and repair to the Ponce for breakfast. You feel battered physically and mentally; waves of nausea wash past throughout the day, as do headaches and dizziness. You mull events, trying to get a grip on the strangeness of your adventure, which is already taking on a dreamlike quality. Looking down a street you experience a double-vision effect and see the landscape of the Feywild overlaying it &#8211; or is it just a hallucination? In the dining room of the inn all the patrons briefly flicker into visions of fey creatures &#8211; don\u2019t they? It\u2019s a day for rest, healing, repair, and perhaps even a moment of relaxation if possible. By evening the effects have mostly passed. It&#8217;s autumn in Dunstrand vale and you\u2019re able to enjoy a &#8216;dinner in&#8217; at the lodge Sir Anthony and the lord have provided, and somewhat come to grips with what\u2019s real and what might have been imagined (or what you might want to tell yourself you only imagined). Fresh venison from the fall hunt with late season vegetables give you a sense of being grounded in a more normal world again. Leaves rattle around the courtyard in the gusting wind, but the skies are clear and the duchy is a good place to be in the harvest season.\n<\/p>\n<p>THE COMING OF TAZIA &#8211; The Witch<\/p>\n<p>RABAT: You are surrounded in your dream by a circle of your friends at first, but it splits. A strange, beautiful woman clad in a gown nearly translucent walks through the broken circle to you. Sparkles of all colors drop off of her as she moves to you, creating a shimmering effect that transfixes you. She reaches and and caresses your face. &#8220;My servants have done well with you&#8221;, she murmurs. &#8220;They were right to extend the path of power to you, and your friends. I will guide you along that path human-child. In return you swore service to me. You cannot refuse me now when I say to you that you must go as you were going, seeking what you were. Among the faerie folk you will meet one known as Syree S&#8217;pree. Her you must ultimately remove her from her position for she works against your purposes and mine. However you choose to accomplish this is irrelevant. Remember this, you OWE me. I giveth, and i taketh away. You will be rewarded well. I give you this (she waves her hand and a bag appears floating in midair, which you take). Place in it a token of her so that i know you have done the deed &#8211; her head, or whatever you think will appease me and when you close it, it will return to me&#8221; (she laughs a little too boisterously for your tastes, you visibly cringe) &#8211; &#8220;Ohoh I am sorry, I did not mean to make you fear me. I wish your service out of love!&#8221; She takes your hand and begins to dance. You spin and spin and time passes. She and you laugh with joy and scream in delight. She makes you promise your service to her and she promises power to you. You wake up feeling supremely serene, but with an incredible hangover. Standing around you are your friends, you appear to have broken several mugs and furnishings around you\u2026 embarrassed you stand up. They tell you they all had the same dream, then you were dancing for hours through the night &#8211; keeping everyone awake, and no one had the strength to stop you. They only heard one side of the conversation while you are dancing (in describing the shouts you were making), and it makes them visibly suspicious.\n<\/p>\n<p>You decide there is no harm in telling them about your new found powers and how they came to be, since they basically already know anyway. \u201cThe Summer Queen of Faerie\u201d is your patron\u201d, says Tazia. \u201cAnd now we are all embroiled in the politics of that fey land. For a long while i have stayed clear of the Unseelie politics, focusing on my mission to help women. But now it seems we are to be drawn in. We must tread lightly, these maneuverings can easily get us killed.\u201d\n<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Up_the_Nanford_River\/Never_get_off_the_Boat\/Apocalypse_Now\"><\/span>Up the Nanford River\/Never get off the Boat\/Apocalypse Now<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><b>Note to the Party from Sponsors<\/b>: Careful study and decryption of some of the \u2018relevant materials\u2019 has yielded the location of something very important to our shared tasks.

He wears the symbol of [Aerna] and is arrayed with weapons as a holy warrior. He hails the party: \u201cFriends &#8211; a word if you please.\u201d [Have the player RP this part:] You immediately begin describing how you have been crisscrossing the Vale of Dunstrand, seeking the source of some evil that needs to be rectified. Lately you\u2019ve been powerfully drawn down the river road, toward a small hamlet by a lake or pool &#8211; the \u2018vision\u2019 of that isn\u2019t entirely clear; but last night as you were walking this road you were suddenly cast to your knees by the presence of your patron and heard their voice telling you to wait on this very spot for an \u2018unusual\u2019 group of travellers that would bear the standards of the king and the duke. You immediately stopped and bivouacked right beside the road to wait. Moreover, when you awoke you found in the ashes of your campfire a single unburned branch, knotted into a symmetrical pattern. You feel that this token will mean something to the party &#8211; perhaps a vouchesafe of some sort.  Beedel and Tazia both see that this is an oak branch, and know this knotwork as one of the symbols of Nandha\/Nerislan. <\/p>\n[From Eric Swanson Notes] [This section is for play with Harper as a player character] \u201cIn the early afternoon you encounter a halfling riding toward you on a donkey. He\u2019s more \u2018martially\u2019 equipped than your usual halfling farmer and hails you, asking if you were referred to a \u2018Harper Greenwain\u2019 via letter? He is Harper, and shows you a ring with a familiar symbol on it. He came out from Athlapoole to meet you \u201cOn this fine steed loaned to me by the Surefoot Merchant Coster\u201d as he gives the donkey a friendly slap. He\u2019ll accompany you on the rest of the trip to Athlapoole.\u201d Thus does Harper join the party.<\/p>\n<p>On road 2 hours, meet holy warrior and priest traveling together (of different faiths).<br \/>\nDevosa &#8211; had a vision of evil and was instructed to be here in order to deal with it. Delyth cam seeking a similar draw.\n<\/p>\n<p>Beedle is drawn to a Vine chocked tree, beedle kneels and screams and writhes after he clears it = transforming (ears, horns) [[loses fighter level, adds druid 1]].\n<\/p>\n<p>We arrive at the Merry Elven Lass (1 story) where Duward is the innkeep. Also of note is Grugs Longbeards trading shop. Our mission is to travel to the ruins of Kindredale (abandoned), retrieve a Vial of blood, and it will help us in gaining further knowledge dealing with our mission of tracing ancient lineages. We hire a boat to take us up the Athla river, tributary river of Nanford. The hills were once a Great area &#8211; bountiful grazing and small valley farms.<br \/>\n<b>Boat Travel<\/b>: +1 night = 2nd day, 10 miles a day = 2+ days<\/p>\n<p>Monkey\/Goblins in trees, skeletons hanging in trees.

The goblins bowed down to the skull and iron crown of the skeleton king, in order to get past them. But, in a clever twist the party killed them in their moment of vulnerability &#8211; they are goblins. Going downstream we could get all the way back to Athlapoole in a long day, but we all know that&#8217;s up in the air, with all the other strange events transpiring. As we pass by the stone bridge, everything is eerily quiet. Nothing moves and you risk making a run for it. Just as you thought you would make it past unharmed, a hail of stones and spears comes out of the fog. One stone breaks Tazias leg, and she screams out. The rest of the party begins rowing to get back down river as fast as possible.\n<\/p>\n<p>A fog seems to encase the boat as you begin the trip back home, almost pulling at the boat, holding it back. The boat is traveling SLOWER than the current, and you know that there is still something&#8230; evil, afoot. Tazia is insistent that the group return to a search for rare flora that may yield healings, purgatives, and who knows what mystical and expensive ingredients. She found species that clearly indicate their presence in the ecosystem. Despite her wound, she can tell you what to look for. Its been several hours, but the diffused light through the fog does not seem to diminish when dark should be coming on. And you swear that you heard a horse nicker from the fog shrouded banks a couple times.\n<\/p>\n<h4><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Beedel%E2%80%99s_Transformation\"><\/span>Beedel&#8217;s Transformation<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n<p>Beedel is restless &#8211; he paces back and forth, heightening the tension on the ship. Beedle demands to put in to shore, there is something about the feel of the earth that he is craving and it is driving him mad. The party needs to put in to get a better assessment of the shape of the boat and Tzias leg, and Beedle leads them to a small copse of mixed trees along the bank where the sun is shining and there is no fog &#8211; oak, holly, beech, etc. Beedel is unable to relax or settle dow; shortly, Beedel \u201cYou feel that something in the nearby copse is amiss, and is calling to you. It\u2019s like a burr in your boot that keeps digging into your skin.\u201d Upon entering the copse he finds a small oak tree (about eight feet tall) that\u2019s being strangled by vines. Oak being a sacred tree, and particularly sacred to the Vale and Nandhe, he knows this must be healed. \u201cBeedel, you feel something different about this moment &#8211; you feel energy in the earth beneath your feet and know instinctively that you can harness the magic of the land itself to draw off the choking vines and heal the oak. Looking around you spot mistletoe growing &#8211; in fact in your vision it\u2019s glowing in the dusk.\u201d Beedle bounds forward, and the entire party follows to protect him. Even Tazia is hauled along &#8211; leave no one behind being the motto. Tazia can see the draw of the land, and the tree, working on Beedel, and says so in hushed tones as a silence falls o ver the glade. &#8220;Taking a sprig of the mistletoe, you kneel before the stricken oak, close your eyes, and let your mind sink into the earth &#8211; letting go of control. You begin quietly chanting in a tongue no one understands; and as you do, the vines unwind themselves from the oak and crawl across the ground to climb old deadwood.\u201d Beedel has used a spell (druidic cantrip) for the first time.\n<\/p>\n<p>The oak&#8217;s leaves unwither and the tree straightens itself; from somewhere you hear a sound of relief from pain and words spoken in sylvan, for those who understand it: \u201cThank you\u201d. Beedel falls to the ground moaning, then screaming and writhing in pain. \u201cYou feel a prickling and burning all over your torso and legs, pain around the crown of your head and ears, and a terrible pain in your groin (like being kicked repeatedly). You writhe, claw and grasp at your body.\u201d A green light is visible coming out of the ground and moving over his body. The grass and plants within the light wiggle about and grow. After about half a minute Beedel begins to calm, then by the end of another very long minute the pain is over. For those who are highly perceptive, or choose to examine him closely: His body is somewhat transformed, though not obviously; he has much more hair on his torso and legs (not like animal fur, but like an extremely hirsute man); along the sides of his head, under his hair at the crown, small ridges of horn &#8211; reminiscent of a rams\u2019 horns &#8211; have come out; he ears have developed a minor pointedness; and other \u2018satyr-like reproductive traits\u2019. None of this is obvious to anyone, though particularly aware observers will notice that his beard or stubble (or however he wears it) is quite a bit thicker and darker than it was.\n<\/p>\n<p>Beedel is exhausted by this, and feels the lingering effects of physical shock and trauma, including aches in all the places transformations took place. He can feel that some of his prowess as a warrior has left him, but he\u2019s also imbued with new abilities, able to draw on the magic of the land itself. (Fighter level reduced by one, druid level one replaces it.)\n<\/p>\n<h4><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Arrival_of\"><\/span>Arrival of ____<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n<p>In silence, the party returns to the boat and resumes their journey. Arriving at the boat, they notice that a figure is laying, soaking wet and exhausted upon the deck of the boat.\n<\/p>\n<h4><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"A_Dangerous_Fog\"><\/span>A Dangerous Fog<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n<p>As night should fall, you get even more nervous. Everyone feels a hunger, an evil malevolence controling the that the river that is trapping them, and the boat is almost standing still as the current flows past it. Something is drawing them to a point, and rather than fight, the group decides to make landfall. Strange sounds are heard in the fog all around, and a heaviness hangs in the air. Once out of the main current and hitched to a tree, no change is made in the boat&#8217;s position. It is drawn up onto shore and a campsite made. Tazia stays behind while the rest see if a tree can be climbed or a hill to get a better view. As you secure the boat, the river bank around you goes silent and the fog moves back to the edge of your firelight. Moving inland, the hairs on the back your neck stand up. You make your way further inland, no tree seems high enough to get above the fog. You finally push to the base of a hill, hoping to ascend and get a clearer view. Around you, nothing moves &#8211; no sound of birds, insects, or even a breeze.
