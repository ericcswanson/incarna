Smuggling was a dangerous profession in the land of law that is Cormyr. The danger appeals to the cocky Dashel. He likes to be the underdog, and is a compulsive gambler (Sanity save DC 10 to avoid accepting any wager). He is a braggart, and used to intimidating his way out of most problems. When this fails, he has the magic of the ring that he found to \u201cexit stage left\u201d as he calls it. His adventures have taken hm all over southern Faerun and some of the sword coast. During that time he won both of his blades from wagering an evil duelist who made his living fleecing and holding hostage wounded adventurers coming out of the Underdark near Waterdeep. He won his ring of spells from a drunk war wizard in Cormyr. His boots he gained from a druid near the Dalelands north of Cormyr. Fleeing a shipwreck from being pursued by Sembias navy (there were  rumors of an army approaching it from the east and they were highly aggressive) and grounding a boat, he made his way and lost himself deep in some woods. Tired and starving, he stumbled across a beautiful elf in a violet glade of light. Playing the addled traveler in the hopes of duping the elf, he wagered and lost. Not realizing what the bet truly was, he was pulled into the heart of the forest, where shadows cast strange colors and the sun has never shown. Lost in a haze for days, mocked by the echoing laughter of the elf who had wagered him, he finally made his way to the water\u2019s edge of a sea. It looked vaguely familiar (like the Dragonmere), yet the flora and fauna were alien. The sounds and smells were not right.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Fighter 9th Hit Dice: 6 x 9 = 54 + 27 = 81 Hit Points Strength: 11 Intelligence: 12 [+1] Wisdom: 13 [+1] Dexterity: 17 [+3] Constitution: 16 [+3] Charisma: 14 {+2] Sanity: 12 [+1] Proficiencies @ +4 Skills: Perception (Wisdom), Stealth (Dexterity), Sleight of Hand (Dexterity), Athletics (Strength), Intimidation (Charisma; expert &#8211; double proficiency), [&hellip;]<\/p>\n<a role=\"link\" class=\"rtp-readmore\" title=\"Read more on Dashel Killrey\" href=../../../../22http/incarnanet/host/sean-drew/chars/dashel-killrey/22_557804660.html rel=\"nofollow\">Read More \u2192<\/a>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"parent":364,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":[],"categories":[],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/6871"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=6871"}],"version-history":[{"count":3,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/6871\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":6879,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/6871\/revisions\/6879"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/364"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=6871"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=6871"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=6871"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
