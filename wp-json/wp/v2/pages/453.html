Get up and act out what your character says and their mannerisms - pretend you are them and faced with the same circumstances. Don't be afraid to be funny, scared, or serious - exaggerate the situation and emotions in order to make a point. What your character plans and says can often be enough for an obvious outcome. We believe <a href=../../../../22/game/gm/advisehtml/index_1258706955.html class=\"link-gm\">GM's<\/a> should encourage <a href=../../../../22/game/play/advisehtml/index_1748569420.html class=\"link-play\">Players<\/a> to role-play (and possibly grant bonuses to checks - from a minor +1, to <a style=\"text-shadow: 1px 1px 1px #C0C0C0;\" title=\"The check gains the benefits of Advantage\"><i><b>Advantage<\/b><\/i><\/a> <i class=\"fa fa-refresh\"><\/i> (similar to <a href=../../../../22/characters/trait_945892135.html>Superior Luck<\/a> or <a href=../../../../22/characters/trait_945892135.html>Leadership<\/a>), or automatic success, rather than ONLY rely on the rules of the game to resolve encounters. This also makes for better GM <a class=\"link-gm\" href=../../../../22/game/gm_658013250.html>narration<\/a>. Good <a href=../../../../22http/enwikipediaorg/wiki/Role-playing/index_1316432226.html>role-playing<\/a> means the characters are engaged dramatically, one of the first steps to a truly memorable experience. <\/p>\r\n<p title=\"If your character does not seem to have the requisite proficiency to attempt an action and all other requirements are met, the GM may allow an attempt based on raw ability.\"><i class=\"fa fa-minus-square\"><\/i> <em><b>What if I don't have the necessary Ability, <a href=../../../../22/characters/skill/22_357959185.html>skill<\/a>, <a href=../../../../22/characters/trait/22_173215240.html>trait<\/a> or power?<\/b> Remember - part of challenge of role-playing is also acknowledging what you (AND your character - who may not have the experience to make the same informed decisions a player can) cannot do, and working within those limits.

The quality requirement may be less the more role-playing draws out the scene explicitly. <\/p>\r\n<p><i class=\"fa fa-smile-o\"><\/i> At the heart of it all is role-playing - never let mechanics or rules stand in the way of or superseded good role-playing. Characters should be played using their defined knowledge, mannerisms, and abilities as best they can by both GM and player. Only the GM knows all the factors governing the situation, directing players to apply adjustments, or make them for the players when assessing the resolution.<\/p>\r\n<\/div><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<a role=\"link\" class=\"rtp-readmore\" title=\"Read more on Meditation\" href=../../../../22http/incarnanet/act/meditation/22_1562116401.html rel=\"nofollow\">Read More \u2192<\/a>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"parent":35,"menu_order":39,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":[],"categories":[],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/453"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=453"}],"version-history":[{"count":2,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/453\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":2458,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/453\/revisions\/2458"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/35"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=453"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=453"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=453"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
