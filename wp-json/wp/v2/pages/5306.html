He became a well known fixture among the beggars and accomplished pick pockets.<br \/>\nAt the age of 14, on a dare, he stole a ride on the wagon of the wizard Billblotz. He ended up inside his enclosed compound. No one saw Aaro for 7 years, until he reappeared from the compound. He has gone on to hire himself as a mercenary troubleshooter locally. He made a local name for himself when defending a steading against hill giants that came raiding one winter. He&#8217;s also seemed to remain friends with the enigmatic Billblotz &#8211; who has provided him guidance in his pathway as an eldritch knight. Aaro likes to keep his past a mystery.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Building_the_Character\"><\/span>Building the Character<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>I had an interesting idea i&#8217;ve not been able to try. The party needs some stealth\/real thief powers. It also needs a switch fighter &#8211; someone good at range and in close if need be. <\/p>\n<p>Basically the idea is that they are a forward ranging character for stealth and trap detection.<br \/>\nInstead of backstab, uses the sharpshooter feat to get bonus to damage with all attacks (not quite as good as full rogue). When not steal\/ambushing, they can operate in the back using a bow, unlock locks, and have misc spells for some backup. As a front line fighter, use dexterity for finesse.<\/p>\n<p>Being able to summon and dismiss as a bonus action the bonded weapons means they can be doing thief stuff and instantly have weapons if needed. It also is a good disguise &#8211; not having to carry weapons means better disguises as peasants dont usually have them. But you can summon instantly if needed. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Class: Fighter (Eldritch Knight) 4th HP = 10,4,7,8 = 29 + 12 = 41 AC = [mage armor + dex or studded Leather +1] Background: Urchin Ability Strength 12 Intelligence 15 Wisdom 12 Dexterity 18 Constitution 16 Charisma 11 Sanity 10 Proficiency BONUS: +2 @ 4th level Skills: Sleight of Hand, Stealth, Perception, Acrobatics Tools: [&hellip;]<\/p>\n<a role=\"link\" class=\"rtp-readmore\" title=\"Read more on Aaro Anseraat (Character)\" href=../../../../22http/incarnanet/host/indraneel-dey/characters/aaro-anseraat/22_757081634.html rel=\"nofollow\">Read More \u2192<\/a>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"parent":3078,"menu_order":14,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":[],"categories":[],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/5306"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=5306"}],"version-history":[{"count":4,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/5306\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":5310,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/5306\/revisions\/5310"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/3078"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=5306"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=5306"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=5306"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
