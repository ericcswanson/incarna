A character with History AND Arcana would recall that the weapon was a nearly impossible creation.\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"know-uncommon\" class=\"tab-pane fade\">Bileagaul was a sword with 8 different components, one from each school of magic. Each piece (pommel, hilt, handle pieces&#8230;.) was imbued with powers from one school of magic. Each piece could be applied to different weapons or combined to recreate Bileagaul itself. Somehow Orlec crafted the pieces to retain their power over time and to be used over and over without fail. The Most unique aspect of these components was the fact that each component retained memory of what it once was, and so when together would always recreate the original weapon. Orlec supposedly made the blade as a challenge to himself, not out of any desire to create a weapon to protect Merowey. He made many items throughout his life, Bileagal became known simply because it was used  by a variety of citizens of Merowey in times of conflict.<\/div>\n<div id=\"know-rare\" class=\"tab-pane fade\"><\/div>\n<div id=\"know-secret\" class=\"tab-pane fade\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Created by Orlec, supposedly given to a Hero of Merowey, though history argues over which hero.
