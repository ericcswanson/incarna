There where no lands where there was no evidence though of the chaos storm. When the last of the anger had died from the dragons in 7825 and the great sleep began again, the dragon mage woke the last of the ancient fire breathers &#8211; Takremaendys. The god-like dragon uncurled and took flight one final time and flew west. The smouldering isle of Forlad, one the few places of landfall thousands of miles across the sea was landfall for the dragons. Takremaendys brought forth the land long submerged.

A land birthed in the dreams of dragon, in divine power, in ancient knowledge and with the energy beyond the world. Into the land did the dragon-mage scatter the dreams of the great dragons.
