When you do so, choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you and expend one superiority die. That creature can immediately use its Reaction to make one weapon attack, adding the superiority die to the attack\u2019s damage roll.<\/p>\n<p>Style: Protection (modified) When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose Disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a weapon that is not &#8220;Light&#8221; or a shield. If using a shield, the wielder may interpose themselves between the target and attacker using their Bonus Action, taking the damage and not interfering with the target&#8217;s further actions.<\/p>\n<p>Feat: Charger (modified &#8211; for stopping crowds)<br \/>\nWhen you use your action to Dash, you can use a bonus action to make one melee weapon attack or to shove a creature. If you move at least 10 feet in a straight line immediately before taking this bonus action, you either gain a +5 bonus to the attack\u2019s damage roll (if you chose to make a melee attack and hit) or push the target up to 10 feet away from you (if you chose to Shove [Athletics vs. Athletics or Acrobatics] and you succeed). If the shove succeeds, you may knock the target Prone instead; If it succeeds and and is a Major result, 2 targets may be shoved back 10&#8242;; 3 targets on a critical.

It is the old elven made sword of Theodore the Wise. Theodore was a local hero of Rakefield from a hundred years ago, who made a name for himself fighting strange spirits and undead that came from Calibans Slurry; no explanation of who or what caused these spirits and walking dead was ever discovered. The sword was made by elves, and found in an old forgotten place where the elves once dwelled in the remote places of Bar-Innis (he explained it no further). For ages it sat above the bar in the Inn at Rakefield. <\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"History\"><\/span>History<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Background: Tanner<br \/>\nDescription: Male, human, age 21, right handed, 155#, 5&#8217;10&#8221;<br \/>\nWhat are they known for &gt; Making his own armor and shield covers.<\/p>\n<p>Joining the Blackwells<\/b>: After charging in and knocking down Pops in his battle with House Malor, he was offered a place among them by Bailyn and Star.
