He used the weapon (poignard) his father once stole from a dead adventurer. He is a reluctant light worshiper, and probably not long for being a pious man &#8211; it slips away every day. He fled Bar-Innis into the Riverdans, and made his way to Terbans Cross. He finds more in common with the adventurers he met, though he was happy to take Balthazaars favor in tracking down the highwaymen that terrorized the area. Rabat and friends were able to recover the stolen Light of Balthazaar, but Rabat &#8220;accidentally&#8221; touched it &#8211; draining him forever, but opening his eyes to the wonderment of the world.\n<\/p>\n<p>You had just tracked down down some highwaymen that stole &#8220;the light of Balthazaar&#8221; from a church&#8230; there were rival factions of gaia and Balthazaar &#8211; but it turns out it was not religious strife, but highwaymen trying to frame the Gaia worshipers. <a href=../../../../22/host/tom-potter/chars/horun/22_1835412313.html>Horun<\/a> was on the side of Gaia. Rabat for Balthazaar&#8230; Rabat realizes that the whole religious zeal thing may not be what he expected. He&#8217;s not much of a follower like that and the church of light is losing its flavor, so Rabat made up with Horun and both went with the group to the city.\n<\/p>\n<p><b>Pact<\/b>: The Feywild alters Rabat &#8211; his sense reach out as he travels through the hedge maze of the minotaur, and dark voices whisper in his head. The lure of power is great, and wielding magic will get him the respect he has always craved! On the vine bridge, crossing back into the Steel Realms he promises great deeds in the name of the arch-fey that guards over the place if he can take back but a fraction of their power. The spirit of Waele, patron of the temple of the moon they were at agrees to serve as messenger to his mistress, Titania, the Summer Queen of faerie. She agrees to Rabat&#8217;s wishes, granting him his rudimentary powers. Waele also grants him rudimentary knowledge of Feyloise &#8211; the elven mother tongue.\n<\/p>\n<p><a href=../../../../22http/incarna5thdndblogspotcom/p/converted-rabathtml/index_780024919.html>Conversion<\/a> from <a href=../../../../22https/drivegooglecom/open_1316705857.html>original Incarna v 2<\/a><br \/>\n<--[contentblock id=char_idnd1]--><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Description: Human, male, 5\u20198&#8243;, #138, age: 20, platinum blonde hair, short hair, grey eyes, right handed; serpent tattoos on his legs; Size: Medium; Move = 30&#8242; + the mark of the Summer Queen (on his inner thigh there is a tattoo of Titania in her garden) PROFICIENCY BONUS = +2 Class: Rogue 2nd\/Warlock (lesser) 1 [&hellip;]<\/p>\n<a role=\"link\" class=\"rtp-readmore\" title=\"Read more on Rabat (Character)\" href=../../../../22http/incarnanet/host/sean-drew/chars/rabat/22_1999928331.html rel=\"nofollow\">Read More \u2192<\/a>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"parent":364,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":[],"categories":[],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/2752"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2752"}],"version-history":[{"count":11,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/2752\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":3775,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/2752\/revisions\/3775"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/364"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2752"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2752"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2752"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
