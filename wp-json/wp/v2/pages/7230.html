The Winter People were mountain valley folk, with auburn hair, pale skin and living at great heights among the blustery cold winds. They worshiped a strange elemental power named &#8220;Achrae&#8221;, also called &#8220;The Lonely Voice&#8221; &#8211; Achrae roamed the remote peaks searching for a counterpoint to his whistling voice. They had a tradition of powerful magic and song, though there were few of them. Icrane was brought up strong on his family traditions, and became a sorcerer like his grandfather and mother before him. He took on song and dance, to take his mother\u2019s place and lead the people of his village in their ceremonies.<\/p>\n<p>He learned the powerful voice he had by singing from the high mountain tops to echo for as long as he could. He followed the hunters of his clan and sang them the song of war to bolster their courage and used the wind he summoned to amplify his voice. He withstood the trials of ice, wind, and lightning with his mother in order to wrestle the powers of the elements.<\/p>\n<p>Following his people\u2019s traditions, he left them for a year and went north, following the peaks into Ghunfar to have his far-ranging time as all of the singers must, and return with knowledge of the outside world and tell stories of it. For months he watched the edges of civilized society, learning their ways and the dialect of his people&#8217;s language.<\/p>\n<p>In Ghunfar he struggled, but soon fell in with a band of violent sell-swords called the Death\u2019s Cradle. He was saved by them, nearly killed by a runaway cart in one of the cities when Elid the Stoney stepped in and saved him. In Icrane\u2019s culture, his life was then bonded to Elid. Forced into depravity and violence, he served a full three years in the debt to Elid before he repaid it.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Civil_War_of_Meritan\"><\/span>Civil War of Meritan<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>The mercenaries were hired by the council of Meritan. Suspicions grew over time, of council members acting inappropriately. Two factions of the city of Meritan plunged it into civil war. The faction of Sir Hugh Duvre lead a people\u2019s army against the governor and council which had overtaxed the populace and left little to defend them from the marauders of the steppe that were preying on the caravans and fields. The civil war lasted over 4 months and at least 10,000 were killed. At first, the civil war was a war of factions in the streets. Then the council got desperate and enjoined the smugglers and thieves of the city &#8211; and even a few shady mercenary bands on the sly. Soon, civilians were turning on each other and the city burned. Trade crashed, fortunes fell, and the population fled. Sir Hugh turned to desperate tactics himself lives of innocents were snuffed out in reprisal. Sir Hugh Duvre was captured and hung and quartered for his crimes. The people were brutally suppressed just before a force of the king\u2019s arrived to take matters into his hands.
