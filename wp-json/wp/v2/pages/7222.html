One of three apprentices, Telemet had come to Orlec as many do &#8211; trough  magic and not of his own will. He never let on the circumstances, but trained his three apprentices after he gathered them up in 1 year. For 6 years did he train &#8211; sent out over long distances to find rare plants and creatures and bring them back (or parts of them). It turns out that Telemet was not truly altruistic. In a ritual in which Telemet tried to get home, he may have succeeded. The apprentices were used as offerings to a dark power. The tower was engulfed in flames and magic. Nicodemus managed to protect himself with a flash of Insight by grabbing his spell book and leaping out the window as the circle of protection was broken. He would have survived the tower\u2019s demise were it not for falling debris. It took him 7 days to die. On the 7th day, he was found by Kefjen the druid (a centaur) at deaths door. Kefjen could not heal him &#8211; such was not his powers. However, he could ease his passing. And drugged from the pain easing roots, he told the druid his story as he slipped in and out of consciousness. Impressed by his sacrifice, the druid called upon the power of the land. When Nicodemus finally passed, the spirit of the great lizard came and formed for him another body &#8211; that of a lizard man. Although he did not grow up in their culture, he got the physical characteristics of his new body. Nicodemus was surprised at how easy he took to swimming. Kefjen helped ease his transition into a new body over several months and accompanied him to a trade settlement nearby. He said he was following a star in the night sky &#8211; and others of his kind had seen it. He gifted him with his own magical shield and told him that the winds had said that Nicodemus would need it more. <\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Meeting_Icrane\"><\/span>Meeting Icrane<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Ritual_of_the_Dark_Sun\"><\/span>Ritual of the Dark Sun<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>The character participated in the ritual along with the rest of Icrane\u2019s group. <\/p>\n<p>Dark Revenge: When the character dies, they become a shadow and try and kill their former companions<br \/>\nThe character gains resilient on an ability (proficiency) and permanent disadvantage with another (players choice).<br \/>\nCharacter can cast Death Ward 1\/Long Rest (shadow gone if protection engaged \u2013 no Stealth)<br \/>\nCharacter gains Expertise in a skill<br \/>\nParanoia: The character will never spend their last spell, munition, etc \u2013 it will always be held in reserve to save themselves \u2013 and they will be vocal about not being able to count on anyone.<br \/>\nCharacter can see twice as far as normal in the dark <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Wizard 6th [Abjuration] Desc: Lizard Man (reincarnated human), male, 6\u2019 5\u201d, #240, green scales, yellow eyes, right handed Strength: 15 \/ Intelligence: 17 \/ Wisdom: 10 \/ Dexterity: 12 \/ Constitution: 12 \/ Charisma: 8 \/ Sanity: 12 HD: 6, 4, 4, 4, 4, 10 + 6 = 38 -1 Blood Oath = 37 HP [&hellip;]<\/p>\n<a role=\"link\" class=\"rtp-readmore\" title=\"Read more on Nicodemus (character)\" href=../../../../22http/incarnanet/host/theodore/char/nicodemus/22_103693420.html rel=\"nofollow\">Read More \u2192<\/a>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"parent":6728,"menu_order":11,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":[],"categories":[],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/7222"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=7222"}],"version-history":[{"count":2,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/7222\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":7224,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/7222\/revisions\/7224"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/6728"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=7222"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=7222"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=7222"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
