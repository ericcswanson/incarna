Soon after his act of creation, he was attacked fearlessly by Jack and Silvas (killed in the battle), the sword Boneshaker was nearly destroyed, and he was laid low. The remains of his attackers gathered themselves and made their way to finding the way home. Hiding in the ashes was Orom&#8217;s apprentice named Orlec. Orlec tried to stop his master, and was changed into a snail. The magics ceased once his master was utterly destroyed. Orlec gathered the remains of his master&#8217;s craft he could find and set out on his own. He gathered power from his dead master and was able to navigate the perils of the forming world as it grew. It had a will of its own, though Orlec made sure his name was heard everywhere he went. He became a legend, and faded to obscurity. No one knows the true fate of Orlec, or if they do they are not speaking of it. As the world&#8217;s second citizen &#8211; after his dead master &#8211; and most prolific one in its early days, folk just took it upon themselves to call it the Lands of Orlec. It became Orlec in short time, after all traces of him (or her?) vanished. <\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"The_Places\"><\/span>The Places<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=../../../../22/items/availability/22_724242504.html>COST PORTION<\/a>: 200 Silver Crowns is what the average starting adventuring PC manages to beg, borrow, earn and steal to start their life with<\/li>\n<\/ul\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"The_Peoples\"><\/span>The Peoples<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Languages\"><\/span>Languages<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>As the majority of the early inhabitants were brought from other places, predominantly the Steel Realms, the languages are mostly imported.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Dundarum<\/b> is the primary language<\/li>\n<li><b>Feyloise<\/b> Elvish &#8211; but a very large difference in dialect<\/li>\n<li><b>Haushren<\/b> The Kaithllen language<\/li>\n<li><b>Impari<\/b> The language brought to the world by the denizens of Montvin<\/li>\n<li><b>Koondelesse<\/b> The languages of the varying native tribes (about 12 different languages and dialects that will likely die when civilization comes)<\/li>\n<li><b>Draconic<\/b><\/li>\n<li><b>Orrish<\/b><\/li>\n<li><b>Giantesh<\/b><\/li>\n<li><b>Primordial<\/b> An oddly pervasive knowledge of the languages of elementals.
