To his family (part of the Diplomat Caste), he was weak &#8211; he enjoyed the drink too much and spoke like a human, and was not cultured like one of The Folk should be. Aggressive and more prone towards a warrior caste, he was the shame of his family and clan. He was given a job away from the Holt, where he could have little impact on the young ones and not embarrass himself too much. He was to guard an Outholt of the new scout position in the T\u2019Yendi hills of eastern Dunstrand. He got drunk on watch and stumbled and rolled into a ravine. Unprecedented in its timing, it left the main entrance to the outholt unguarded at night, a day before they were to install all the trap defenses. While unguarded, several Orrish raiders slipped in and murdered his peers and some of the diplomats. When he woke, it was to the sounds of his own people searching for him. They believed him to have been taken captive, and killed. He slunk off in the next night in utter shame, and knew he could never return to the ways of his people. He wanted several time to kill himself, but could not. He sold his blade as a mercenary and traveled up the Beyne River to Lake Caolite, drinking every silver he made and never keeping a contract long. He finally arrived in Salt Marsh, and discovered a shrine to the fallen death god Djerduth\u2026 he gave all of his possessions in the hopes he would be killed. The \u2018priest\u2019 took him in and managed to get the full drunken story from him, and offered him a path to penance. To serve the order of Necromancers as a living sacrament to death. Each day, he would be broken, flayed, burned, and healed just a little as a research subject until he could find penance in taking an evil life for each \u2018good\u2019 life he let slip through his charge. He learned the cleansing of the scourge and to keep the horrible demon of drink at bay through it. <\/p>\n<p>Despite his self loathing, he has kept his ax and armor. He wears his caste torc upside down under his armor. Normally not prone to speech among others, he is not like others of his kind. He is not humble and reserved and says something when he has something to say. He still holds his racial bias and considers mankind&#8217;s cities junkyards.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"A_Problem_with_the_Living\"><\/span>A Problem with the Living<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><a href=../../../../22/host/larry-james/chars/gabrella/22_1309548065.html>Gabrella<\/a>, <a href=../../../../22/host/marc-chapman/chars/emily/22_192049779.html>Emily<\/a>, <a href=../../../../22/edward-berg/chars/dairn/22_223760430.html>Dairn<\/a>, <a href=../../../../22/host/kelly-royal/chars/justav/22_1132362303.html>Justav<\/a>, <a href=../../../../22/host/tara-flannery/chars/toulath-silverhair/22_875904257.html>Toulath<\/a>, and <a href=../../../../22/host/steven-grenier/chars/gaardu/22_102517828.html>Gaardu<\/a> have joined forces to track down and evil renegade of the Narcosa Necromancer Guild and stop hm before he can do something horrible. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Fighter 1st Description: Size [Medium] 4\u201910\u201d, Movement 25\u2019, Ducateon (dwarf), male, age: 25, right handed, #200, reddish-gray hair, brown-grey eyes Background: Outkast (Ducateon Diplomat caste) &#8211; Personality Trait: I feel more comfortable by myself than around other people. &#8211; Ideal: I must earn glory in battle for myself and my clan in order to regain [&hellip;]<\/p>\n<a role=\"link\" class=\"rtp-readmore\" title=\"Read more on Gaardu (Character)\" href=../../../../22http/incarnanet/host/steven-grenier/chars/gaardu/22_945377797.html rel=\"nofollow\">Read More \u2192<\/a>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"parent":366,"menu_order":25,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":[],"categories":[],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/5044"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=5044"}],"version-history":[{"count":6,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/5044\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":5089,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/5044\/revisions\/5089"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/366"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=5044"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=5044"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=5044"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
