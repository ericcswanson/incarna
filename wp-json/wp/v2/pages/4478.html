There is no interactive participation by the players \u2013 the GM sets out the details according to their plot needs. For battles whose outcome alone is &#8216;scripted&#8217;, it is simply a matter of surviving the battle. The script itself will reveal the win, loss or specific outcome of the battle. Rewards, other than the experience rewards, will be set by the scrip and it is simply up to the GM to follow and fill in any details. Story battles are staged clashes at arms where the player&#8217;s characters actively participate and have a risk of death. The participation can be in one of many roles, but the emphasis is fighting. Story battles may already have their ultimate results (though maybe not the battle outcome) decided by story \u2013 for the PC&#8217;s the fate of their &#8216;side&#8217; may already determined, though their individual fate is not. Many things can happen in a battle, depending on plan, order, communication and leadership it can be confusing and difficult. These battles engage the participants fully. They are swirling masses of chaos, violence and adrenaline. Within these story battles, characters can strive using their abilities as best suits them. Obviously not all characters are suited for large battles, and where appropriate, the GM may provide some unique encounters or weighted encounters to suit character skills&#8230; though entering battle will always involve combat of some kind and always entail risk. Both Story and scripted battles can have battle encounters. The outcome of multiple battle encounters can lead to nothing more than a great story, or may feed a Outcome Determination.\n<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"mech\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Story_Battle_Mechanics\"><\/span>Story Battle Mechanics<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>The battle encounters are pre-set by the GM. Each turn, characters will participate in encounters, gaining accomplishment points for their side. In the first phase, characters are offered any encounters marked as &#8216;first&#8217;. After that, they will choose their accomplishment level and be given the title of each encounter and they will choose. Once they choose to have an encounter, they must choose one from the list presented within the accomplishment level. Some encounters can only be attempted or run a limited number of times \u2013 the players will have to choose based on what they feel is best suited for their character and leaving more appropriate options to others. Once the conditions of the battle are complete, the outcome is  presented. At first it may seem like the individual encounter time values are short. However, the characters are assumed to be entering into multiple combats, moving, getting jostled and knocked down in a fierce fight for their life. The danger and real lack of ability to heal much offsets the short exposure to combat. Surviving is the real key. Full killing of foes has a slight reward, but survival of the battle is the key objective. While over simplifying it, if the characters survive the combat it indicates that their foes did less. Each encounter survival means more chance to do damage to the enemy and whittle their opponents down. Its not an exact science, and the encounter accomplishment points may not be weighted perfectly according to the abilities of the participating characters. In such cases, the GM is free to adjust the accomplishment point rewards as they see fit.\n<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"opt\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Battle_Outcome\"><\/span>Battle Outcome<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>If the battle outcome is not determined, each encounter has an accomplishment point value. <\/p>\n<p>Failure has one of 2 point values always based on result of death or removal from battle. The rest range from 5 to 25 points. Each battle will have a point total indicating victory, draw, and defeat. All accomplishment point values are totaled and compared to this value to determine outcome. A battle need not have all the outcome levels &#8211; many only have simple win and loss conditions.\n<\/p>\n<table summary=\"Battle Outcome Results\" class=\"bordered\">\n<caption>Battle Outcome Summary<\/caption>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Result<\/th>\n<th>Condition<\/th>\n<th>Circumstances and Qualifiers<sup>*<\/sup><\/th>\n<th>Result<\/th>\n<\/tr>\n<\/thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Loss<\/td>\n<td>Total<\/td>\n<td>Accomplishment < #<\/td>\n<td>Fallen in battle mandatory, most goods lost, reputation nearly destroyed<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Loss<\/td>\n<td>Complete<\/td>\n<td>Accomplishment > # < #<\/td>\n<td>Fallen in battle possible, goods lost, reputation reduced<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Loss<\/td>\n<td>Partial<\/td>\n<td>Accomplishment > # < #<\/td>\n<td>Fallen in battle possible, goods partially lost, reputation reduced<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Draw<\/td>\n<td>Strategic Loss<\/td>\n<td>Accomplishment > # < #<\/td>\n<td>Fallen in battle possible, goods partially lost, reputation possibly reduced<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Draw<\/td>\n<td>Strategic Victory<\/td>\n<td>Accomplishment > # < #<\/td>\n<td>Fallen in battle possible, goods not lost, reputation untouched<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Win<\/td>\n<td>Partial<\/td>\n<td>Accomplishment > # < #<\/td>\n<td>Fallen in battle possible, goods gained, reputation increased<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Win<\/td>\n<td>Complete<\/td>\n<td>Accomplishment > # < #<\/td>\n<td>Fallen in battle possible, many goods gained, reputation increased<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Win<\/td>\n<td>Total<\/td>\n<td>Accomplishment > # <\/td>\n<td>Fallen in battle possible, great goods gained, reputation greatly increased<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<tfoot>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"5\"><b>*<\/b>: Qualifiers will include minimum number of encounters (regardless of Accomplishment Points) is needed to achieve the result.<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tfoot>\n<\/table>\n<h3 id=\"rew\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Battle_Rewards\"><\/span>Battle Rewards<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>All large battles represent risk to characters, and therefore have their own rewards, independent of other play.
