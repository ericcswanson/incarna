She was found by druids hiding in a sacred grove in the forest &#8211; near death. Nursed back to health, she attended them in exchange for keeping her hidden. She kept the grove clean and spied on the nearby town for them. She managed to survive long enough to be initiated into the cult of Emoirya &#8211; the fox aspect. Stealth, deception, and trickery is what she was best at. She joined caravan guards but always reported back to the nature priests and druids all the news and information she found about the lands around her. Over the years, her travels went further and she began to travel with caravans. After a while she was introduced to mercenary and adventure bands. During this time she gained her penchant for playing harmless but anonymous practical jokes , and a crude sense of humor. She spent years accumulating wealth and sacrifices, placing it in sacred fox dens. She earned her dagger and holy symbol as gifts formed of the power of the Emoiyra. Her brilliant shirt she managed to grab from an adventure with a group she quickly left. Her journeys have taken her far but she is looking for a home. While searching, she followed strange visions in her dreams to an old cave behind a waterfall in some forgotten place. In it there were depictions of a comet, and war, and a fox dancing around the fields of the fallen. The fox leaped up, trying to catch the comet. There was ancient symbols and writings. She copied them down on vellum with a grease marker. Every night she would take them out and study them &#8211; seeing patterns and after many moons she was on the verge of deciphering them.<\/p>\n<p>Her journeys took her to Merowey. There, the unrest and civil war were startling. She reported her findings, and headed for someplace much safer &#8211; the trading town of Moradis about 20 miles away. Moradis was a smaller but busy crossroads. It was a trade gateway to the southeast. It had only about a thousand people, but about half that again in a transient population of travelers. It seemed that there was a tolerance there with so many people from different places coming through. Hemeria decided to be open in her affiliation. She began to get calls to perform blessings at birth and name days, at weddings and funerals. Being literate made her an occasional witness for documents. <\/p>\n<p>Meeting Icrane:<br \/>\nIt is through this that she Met Paula and Icrane. Her smooth way with words had reached them and they were betrothed to be married. Paula insisted on a small wedding, but Icrane wanted something more public. A friendship developed with them &#8211; Icrane seemed much distracted and that had plans to follow. Something happened that made the couple set a firm date, and within only a week. After knowing them for only a month, she had developed a strong bond. One night, while drinking, Icrane let slip his plans to return to Merowey. She asked about his involvement there in the civil war. A great tale came forth, and a sense of guilt. Knowing full well he was a sorcerer, she began to ask about the visions granted to her after the cave paintings she found of the comet. Icrane explained that it must be a sign &#8211; that he too had come for the time of the comet. He asked her to join them when they return and to prepare for the comets return. She agreed and the day after they were married the three of them left for Merowey. In looking at the symbols Icrane revealed that it was wizardly magic &#8211; that her goddess must have lead her and gifted her with such a thing. He explained that last few pieces missing and all was revealed to her.<br \/>\nCave paintings = source of magic initiate<\/p>\n<p><b>Astral Travels<\/b>: The character is involved in a underworld or political dealing that goes wrong \u2013 its an alternate timeline spillover.
