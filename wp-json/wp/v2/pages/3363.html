From above us, a harpy comes at us out of the tree.

I\u2019ve been here longer than you have been alive.  My sword and spells are yours if I can go with you\u201d.<br \/>\nWe agree to let him accompany us and help us find the way out.<br \/>\nWe feel vertigo again and make our way through another brush tunnel to another chamber.

It doesn\u2019t quite cut it all the way through.

She misses her second attack.<br \/>\nDrayfala attacks the vine with a Firebolt, cutting it.<br \/>\nBalder attacks the Nothic, killing it.  The darkness disappears.<br \/>\nThe homunculus scampers into the briar.<br \/>\nTalia goes to Kemlaech and gives him a healing potion.<br \/>\nThe last shrub is destroyed.<\/p>\n<p>We decide to take a long rest.  Drayfala takes the first watch.  While watching, a noose falls on Drayfala\u2019s shoulder.  It is not attached to anything.  He burns it with Firebolt.  We continue our rest and are back to health.<\/p>\n<p>We continue on and are in the next area and attacked by a giant wasp, a giant spider, and a giant centipede.  We can see a door.  We run for it and make it into the next chamber.<br \/>\nWe feel we are falling again.  We find ourselves looking at a wall of hedges and briars.  There are two holes in the hedge.  Drayfala tries Flamestrike on the briars, burning some.  A vine lashes out but misses him.<br \/>\nDrayfala hears muffled laughter, but no one else does.  There is a maze in front of us.<br \/>\nMeena and Kemlaech attempt to figure out the maze and loose Sanity points.<br \/>\nDrayfala walks toward the entrance of the maze.  Nothing happens to him and we all follow him.<br \/>\nThe path leads to an open garden with 8 paths leading out.  We make a pile of pebbles beside the path we came in from.<br \/>\nWe try the first door on the right.  It winds around and ends up back in the main room.  Some of us loose more sanity.<br \/>\nDrayfala casts Lesser Restoration on Kemlaech, restoring half his sanity.<br \/>\nDrayfala casts Bless on Kemlaech.  He goes down the next tunnel and finds nothing.<br \/>\nThen the next one has nothing.<br \/>\nThe next goes farther with an opening to his right that keeps going.  The walls seem alive.<br \/>\nWe all go into that tunnel.  All but Talia make their Sanity checks.<br \/>\nWe go on another 30 seconds.  It curves to the right and branches to the right again.  We decide to go straight.  Talia and Kem take more Sanity damage.<br \/>\nMeena feels we have been here before.  We go back to the original point where the trail went to the right.  We are at a landing.  There are three choices straight ahead and one path down.  We decide to go down.<br \/>\nDrayfala casts Lesser Restoration on Meena and heals her Sanity back to normal.<br \/>\nWe go down through a hedge tunnel.  It is dark and moist.  It continues for a while.<br \/>\nAfter curving around we come to a T.  We decide to take the left.   All but Kem make our Sanity check.<br \/>\nWe twist and turn again and come to another T.  We go to the Right this time.<br \/>\nWe come to a curve where we can go to another T or go straight.  We decide to go straight.<br \/>\nDrayfala casts Lesser Restoration on himself.<br \/>\nWe go back to the T and take a left.<br \/>\nWe come to a point where we go straight.  There is no sanity check.  WE go right again.  We realize we have been here before.  We continue without a Sanity check.  We go a long curving route, but no sanity check.<br \/>\nIt is dark, so Kem casts Dancing Lights.  The lights move away and sputter out.  Kem says there\u2019s something ahead.<br \/>\nBut we don\u2019t run into anything as we curve around.  We see light ahead.  We come out of the tunnels out of the maze.  We see the same fay woman that asked us for our help before and we find ourselves out of the Feywild and back to the circle of stones.<br \/>\nDrayfala sees the Humuclulus running into the forest and blasts him with a Firebolt.  He dies.<br \/>\nKemlaech tells us he has forsworn the Underdarkness and would like to join our party and our mission.<br \/>\nThe Humuculus turns into a corrupt High Elf when he dies.  Drayfala tries to consecrate him.  The curse lifts.<br \/>\nHis cloak and a ring is magic.  2000 GP in jewelry.  The cloak radiates transmutation magic (cloak of the bat).  The ring is a ring of Jumping.  Drayfala receives 2 Bless spells.<br \/>\nDrayfala can send a message to the Elven Council.  We will continue to the Council.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>World of Ph&#8217;yrin Tys! 1\/13\/16 We gain a new party member.
