It is plain in sight for such a powerful blade, but its outward appearance covers the truth that a named creature of Elemental Earth was bound to the blade to empower it. It rings true and clear when unsheathed. The blade itself has many stories which demontrates its primary power to rend and tear asunder armors and shields protecting its targets, and knock prone those who try and stand in its path. There are tales of the blade in the hands of The Gallants of Dunstrand and their annals taking a horrendous amount of damage and not breaking - it is rumored to have scars upon the blade.&nbsp;<\/p>\n> Other Names: \"Bone Breaker\", \"Shield Breaker\"\n<\/div>\r\n  <div id=\"item-know1\" class=\"tab-pane fade panel\"><p>It resists all attempts to further etch, chisel, or carve words or designs to its durable surface. The blade would look to be 15 or more pounds from just its visual appearance, but is much lighter. The blade has a massive \"healed\" scar on its forte (from where it nearly broke), and what appears to be faint scorching \"scar\" on the foible on the opposite side (from the bombardment suffered in another battle on another world). It is rumored to cause fear in magical creatures that dwell in Elemental Earth. It is said that the earth creature imbuing it with power was a true prince of Elementals. It is said that if you stare at the blade long enough in a deep quiet place, the cog-like effect rippling under the surface cause it to shimmer and display scenes of it's history. It was originally seen in 9132 supposedly wielded by the daughter of Gerladine Blackwell - Lady Jaq Blackwell, under the banner of The Gallants of Dunstrand.<\/p>\n> <i class=\"know-more-still\">Typically a DC 15 or higher Check<\/i><\/div>\r\n  <div id=\"item-know2\" class=\"tab-pane fade panel\"><p>The blade was forged by Ghalios Mag'Antis of The University in PanGeDiam (he was the metal weaver) he was known for his study of earthen magic and ultimately focused on manipulating metals. Unlike most of the Mages of the university he preferred to craft his magic not with words but with the stroke a hammer. He was something of an outsider even among the tinkers because he found the tiny component they worked with silly when compared to other magics. But, no one in any of the school could put into doubt his skill at crafting armor and weapon. Bone Shaker was his second attempt at using a large amount of Essence from the future owner. The first attempt was disastrous consuming the would be wielder's soul and part of their physical person. This created a grotesque sword and armor piece, that he has kept as a reminder of his folly. He reached too deeply into a willing student's very being and took Sanity, Charisma, and too much Essence. In the process he became flush with power and he pulled the metal materials he wanted from the students very body destroying him. After creating the marvelous horror he choose to dismiss his remaining students permanently. Crafting weapons and armor as requested and studying to possibly undo his mistake. The simulacrum (soulless) of his student\/victim resides in his workshop. The other magi found his sentimentality over the loss of a single student ridiculous and chided him whenever functions requiring Masters were held. He used the advent of these new comers called the Gallants to practice a technique he had been developing. The results of which he was truly pleased! He took another singularly mammoth risk in making Bone Shaker - his next project, in the same fashion. The elemental's name is Kor (being unpronounceable otherwise) - it is a greater minor prince of Earth Elementals, and a servants of the great one's court that had been bound into service of the Drow, tortured by them under fathoms of water for hundreds of years, and freed by Ghalios on one of the rare raids by The Academy on the Drow lands. His impressive clock work constructs made Kor trust him with his plan to have the elemental prince assume the form of a sword. If ever the blade does break it cannot be re-forged as the elemental will be freed at that point - this was the deal. He could not figure out how to break the Drow bindings, but infused the Essence of Jaq in order that the elemental itself was able to break the final Drow shackles of service. It understood the nature of the plight of Jaq and the Gallantine... revenge it understood quite clearly and so the deal was struck. Quietly he would sleep in the sword, nigh unbreakable.<\/p>\r\n<p>There are many \"nicks\" - scars along the edges, all \"healed\" and representing no structural compromise. The blade was nearly destroyed and a godling on the new world being created healed the sword of the damage it had taken. This pact was put to the test against the fearsome lich\/godling and world destroyer, and once again the elemental prince himself on a battlefield, dying, blasted into molten metal. Not just the sword had been hurt, but the elemental essence has been soul burned. And this time the same human used the blood of a god and favor to heal the blade and Kor - and so the blood of the Blackwell's and that of Kor are bound forever.<\/p>\r\n<p>Totally Unknown: On the tang, under the grip is \"JAQ\"carved and next to it an ancient symbol of the Steel Realms god Malek (the \"hidden one\") indicating an odd alliance. Also, some of the twisted nature of the godling that nearly destroyed it remains - The wounds that it leaves in flesh are clean never jagged - and it absorbs (Wisdom DC 20 to notice) a small bit of blood to sate its thirst from some of the wounds it delivers.<\/p>\r\n<p>After capturing Jaq for her part in a raid against Umbakians in the campaign of the Golden Child, Bone Shaker was taken from her. They tried all manner of breaking it - bend, shatter, fire, magic and in the end sunk it off Queens Coast. The priests of Elancil recovered it, not knowing what it was but its incredible magical aura not easy to ignore, and their transport was lost in a mist. A Ship of Elancil lost in the mist. Off Dwindor Swamp. What really happened no one knows, but an Aasimar - a descendant of the Celestials, found the goblins guarding it on the shores of the halfling lands near Umbak when they had put it in under cover of mist for supplies. He recovered it, and returned it to Jaq - not far away.<\/p>\n> <i class=\"know-more-still\">Typically a DC 20 or higher Check<\/i><\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div><\/div>\r\nPrice: Inestimable\n\r\n<\/div><\/div>\n<div id=\"popmapsrlm\" class=\"hidden\"><a href=../../../../22/wp-content/uploads/srlm-map-handgif/index_1662929950.html><img src=../../../../22/wp-content/uploads/srlm-map-handgif/index_1662929950.html alt=\"Steel Realms Map\" lazyload \/><\/a><\/div><div class=\"modal fade\" id=\"basicModal\" tabindex=\"-1\" role=\"dialog\" aria-labelledby=\"basicModal\" aria-hidden=\"true\">\r\n    <div class=\"modal-dialog\">\r\n        <div class=\"modal-content\">\r\n            <div class=\"modal-header\">\r\n            <button type=\"button\" class=\"close\" data-dismiss=\"modal\" aria-hidden=\"true\">X<\/button>\r\n            <h4 class=\"modal-title\" id=\"myModalLabel\">Modal title<\/h4>\r\n            <\/div>\r\n            <div class=\"modal-body\" id=\"myModalPop\">\r\n            <\/div>\r\n    <\/div>\r\n  <\/div>\r\n<\/div><script>jQuery(\"a[class^='dndclass-cleric'],a[class*=' dndclass-cleric']\").prop(\"href\",\"\/characters\/class\/cleric\");jQuery(\"a[class^='dndclass-fighter'],a[class*=' dndclass-fighter']\").prop(\"href\",\"\/characters\/class\/fighter\");jQuery(\"a[class^='dndclass-ranger'],a[class*=' dndclass-ranger']\").prop(\"href\",\"\/characters\/class\/ranger\");jQuery(\"a[class^='dndclass-barbarian'],a[class*=' dndclass-barbarian']\").prop(\"href\",\"\/characters\/class\/barbarian\");jQuery(\"a[class^='dndclass-druid'],a[class*=' dndclass-druid']\").prop(\"href\",\"\/characters\/class\/druid\");<\/script>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Bone Shaker is beautiful heavy broadsword, made from a metal that seems to glint and ripple, as if a thousand tiny wheels and cogs were moving under its surface.
