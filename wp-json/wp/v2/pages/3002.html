It seems this recent disturbance has awakened the privateer from his sleep of undeath permanently. Now the ship is seen on the edges of fog banks without the full moon, and has attacked and sunk a few merchant vessels carrying goods to and from Troneth Traphaven. It seems like the old privateer has some personal grudge to settle against the living of the town. Trade is beginning to die and the community is getting desperate - the call has once more gone out for aid in defeating the town's enemies.\n<\/p>\r\n<p><b>Motivation<\/b>: <a href=../../../../22https/enwikipediaorg/wiki/MacGuffin/index_1277690982.html>MacGuffin<\/a>? \n\r\n<br \/>Once again, an \"interested party\" (Sira Lucius Delmond IV) has sought out the group through his intermediary Mr. Foxx - mostly for its notoriety and ability to deal with trouble.

The ship was captained by Terrance Blair, a privateer for hire with the reputation of a treasure-hunting scoundrel. A week after her disappearance, her masts and signature grey sails were spotted above the water line off Bear Island - a small rocky island separated from the mainland by a 200 foot stretch of shallow water, and a known hibernation spot for 3-4 bears every winter. The island was once a sacred place, where the wind roars like a bear as it whistles down from the north through the crags in the winter. Many have sought to find out what happened, but now fog encloses the island whenever anyone makes landfall, and they are never heard from again. Some sailors report seeing a ghost ship crewed by the undead on nights of the full moon - a few ship captains even avoid anchoring in the area because of this persistent story. Dozens of adventuring parties have vanished over the years trying to explore either the wreck or island. <\/p>\r\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"The_Interview_with_Mr_Foxx\"><\/span>The Interview with Mr. Foxx<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\r\n<div class=\"panel\"><p>\"It is wonderful to see you, looking healthy and prosperous. I wish it were under less dire circumstances. The trouble, as you know now, has not ended for our business interests. It seems like the ancient forces bottled up at Bear Island for so long will not rest. Whatever angry spirits were woken on the previous sojourn to the island will not rest. The ghost ship of the dead privateer Terrence is now launching attacks on local shipping. In the hundreds of years, his ghost ship has only been glimpsed in the fog around the island. We do not know what has emboldened him, or given him strength or courage to now make long forays beyond the safety and protection of the spirits of the island. We need your strength and cleverness in dealing with this - our profit margins are way down, and the people of the town are upset - every fog bank hides a terror from hell, the thought of long drowned family members clawing their way up from a watery grave has caused talk of abandonment by some. A few have already left. Others are terrified of being attacked if they do leave. Rumors circulate of curses and gods angry for various reasons. The interests I represent simply want this impediment to business gone. A handsome fee of a share of the profits will be yours should you take care of this menace and restore trade and calm.

The distilleries in town give off a faint sickly sweet odor &#8211; from the unique local peat burned which infuses the Troneth Whiskey that&#8217;s famous all around. The town has a central district on the edge of the water &#8211; but no docks. There is a breakwater and safe \u201charbor\u201d in all but the worst of winds. The mouth of the river is a half mile away south. <\/p>\n<p><b>Economic Perspective<\/b>: The town does not have much in the way of local industries for cloth and lumber. Good wood is difficult &#8211; many structures are combinations of mud, mud brick and lumber imported. Plenty of fruit and grasses grow (strangely sweet), but it&#8217;s not good feed for animals. All wool and leather must be imported in a scale to support the town in its operations &#8211; but the whiskey trade and fermented fruit are highly profitable to offset it. Boats are not local though &#8211; all trade stems from outside the area. This is why the threat of a single privateer, and now the rumors have gotten out that the danger is the creeping undead sent up from their watery grave. Trade is slowly coming to a halt, cutting off the lifeblood of the community.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Catching_Terrance\"><\/span>Catching Terrance<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"The_Storm\"><\/span>The Storm<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Bad Weather\/Storm: The party is caught in a terrible storm while trying to wait at sea and ambush the undead pirate.
