Never gain Skilled Linguist, Never gain Skilled Writer, Never gain Persuade above a proficiency bonus, Never acquire Streetwise, Never acquire Occult related essence or levels, Never hold the law of others above the laws and bonds of family\/tribe\/clan, etc., Rarely, if ever, wear modern dress &#8211; preferring tradition, Not wear heavy\/encumbering armor, Not accumulate much more than you or you and a single small mount or vehicle can carry<\/p>\n<p>Pine Tribes Spirit Warrior<br \/>\nSpirit Warriors are those who have pledged themselves to defend the natural places and spirits that dwell there. They despise the undead and animations as unnatural, and sometimes work with the civilized people who border their lands, and the High King\u2019s Rangers in fighting them wherever they are fought. A Few legends exist where these warriors have become rangers themselves. these warriors leave the comfortable tribal life in favor of more remote places \u2013 places of powerful natural beauty and remoteness. Spirit warriors are calm, wiley, and helpful but relentless in combat against their hated foes. They are strong inspirations to the young, and many are quiet; experiencing long moments of stillness where they take in everything around them.<\/p>\n<p>REQUIREMENTS:\u00a0The spirit Warrior class uses the Totem Warrior path (at 3rd level) as a baseline, with the a few important changes.\u00a0The character must have\u00a0Divine Aptitude\u00a0and begins play with\u00a0Piety\u00a0of 1 and chooses their patron spirit-deity of the\u00a0Wyld Faith\u00a0\u2013 must keep the same totem animal through entire Barbarian path of development. Their\u00a0background\u00a0must be Outlander.<\/p>\n<p>Pine Tribes Culture Overview<br \/>\nThere are a few large clans lead by the spirit-men (Shaman); but most are organized into small regional tribes lead by a chief and a medicine-man or woman. They wear a combination of traditional dress and modern \u2013 they only resemble the concept of a cliche savage in that they wear furs and dress appropriately for the clime they are in. They understand currency and use it to trade with outsiders and to varying degrees with each other \u2013 but most trade is a form of barter. They have a strong sense of humor and wit, are easy to laugh, rarely hold grudges (but are quick to fight and settle arguments by contest \u2013 though not necessarily violence). They understand and even teach their youths some of the ways of civilized cultures, but simply prefer the more elemental way of life. The warrior-hunters have a special place in the tribe. A few elite train for nothing but, but many are also farmers, husbands, fathers, kinsmen and tribe members first. They are masters of the use of natural cover though \u2013 having no problem in covering themselves in mud or the like to blend in, where they may not move for days. They do not believe in large pitched battles \u2013 preferring small groups, ambush, and single combat.<\/p>\n<p>Those of the Pine Tribes speak an offshoot of ancient\u00a0Dundarion\u00a0called \u201cDundrav\u201d at a [Conversational] level. With this they can also speak Dundarion\u00a0language\u00a0at [Rudimentary] level. Dundrav uses the same alphabet, has been simplified and is commonly called \u201cWyldsign\u201d. It cannot communicate any idea beyond the [Understandable] level. Tribesmen are all familiar with the written form of Wyldsign at [Primitive] level \u2013 they hide words in natural formations and obscure them with signs only they know of to ward off other tribes and help guide hunters and travelers of their own clan and tribe.<\/p>\n<p>Pine Tribes Winter Warrior Trials\/Tests<br \/>\nThe Trial of the Winter Walkers is similar to a vision quest. The animist spirit-deities of the Wyld Faith, once powerful in the north when the kingdom of Dundaria thrived, still watch over the children of the north. The Ilbarsi and Pine Tribes people still highly venerate them, and draw upon their powers of life and nature to become expert hunters of the Winter Host. Characters may petition for a \u2018Warriors<\/p>\n<p>Spirit Quest\u2019 at the time of character creation.<br \/>\nThe Quest<br \/>\nThe character is tasked with trekking deep into the heart of the fallen kingdom of Dundaria and returning with some personal artifact from a city or town (verified by shamans later). Additionally, they must shadow but never be found by the armies of the Lich Lords on the march. They must bring forth a skull from a slain skeleton or zombie of their armies. They must avoid detection and being hunted down by the Prowl Packs. Sometimes, they can work with locals to lead the packs into an ambush. The spirits of the Wyld are with the character, and if the character tests through the deep pain and ache of the frozen north they are rewarded<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>CHOT\u2019LA 6 TH LEVEL HUMAN PINE TRIBESMAN BARBARIAN TOTEM WARRIOR\/SPIRIT WARRIOR\/WINTER WALKER\/\u201dPELT WEARER\u201d TOTEM: HAWK\/EAGLE Status: Alive; Bannerman Status: Gallantine Company of Dunstrand, Second Squad, 1 st Platoon Description: Human, Pine Tribes, Male, Age 25, Beauty is Average, Size Medium, Hawk tattooed\/branded\/scared on chest CHA 12 (+1) WIS 12 (+1) (+1 Wisdom Checks, Hawk Totem) [&hellip;]<\/p>\n<a role=\"link\" class=\"rtp-readmore\" title=\"Read more on Chotla-archive072016\" href=../../../../22http/incarnanet/host/alfs-kundzins/chars/chotla/chotla-archive072016/22_1432822333.html rel=\"nofollow\">Read More \u2192<\/a>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"parent":1412,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":[],"categories":[],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/4499"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=4499"}],"version-history":[{"count":3,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/4499\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":4512,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/4499\/revisions\/4512"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1412"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=4499"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=4499"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=4499"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
