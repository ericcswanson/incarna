He was given a high level of education and a pampered upbringing due to his parents wealth. A distant relative to the high king he felt privileged and  above all laws. Once he&#8217;d learned all that could be offered at his academy he turned to alternative teachings and skills.<\/p>\n<p>No one paid him any mind as he practiced thieving, stalking, manna infusement and even some less reputable bindings. Adron had an obvious knack for the occult but was never capable of separating his mystical powers from the physical world. From his perspective Magic and ones Physics are linked. Nearly all of his magic affects himself or objects, altering slightly the manner in which the physical world operates. It should not be surprising that he was a natural Arcanist, nor that he often infused his own essence into his magic bindings.<\/p>\n<p>When caught thieving from a visiting family member he was confined to the keep. He busied himself studying its ins and out, soon coming to see physical and magical construction as similar processes. Within a year he was a self taught architect and could find ways in and out of virtually any building, A skill he abused recklessly.<\/p>\n<p>At the age of 19 his family was assassinated by a political rival, causing him to become more reckless. He left his home and joined with an insurgent group that opposed the current regime. He didnt care of what was destroyed are harmed as long as he made his way to those responsible for his family. His skill set made him a natural terrorist, getting in and out of target locations with ease, leaving magically imbued explosives behind. It only took 2 years to obliterate the home of his family&#8217;s rivals.<\/p>\n<p>When he was caught by the authorities he was delivered to his 3rd cousin, an official in the kings court. At first he was going to be tried and imprisoned, but much of his knowledge was deemed valuable. He was tried, given a fake execution, and utilized by the state ever since. Its not perfect in Adrons mind&#8230; but it does give him a purpose.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Adron Wylkes Arcanist Kinetic: 3 Chi: 60 Magic: 3 Manna: 200 normal 180 current (-20 devoted to a woven fetish) Faith: Synergy: Res: 40 Enc: 30 Age: 32 Essence: 24 RCT: 6 VIG: 4 STR: 3 CHR: 4 RSN: 8 SAN: 6 INT: 4 PER: 4 +1 cs APP: normal SIZE: 10 Traits Occult Apprentice [&hellip;]<\/p>\n<a role=\"link\" class=\"rtp-readmore\" title=\"Read more on Original-Adron\" href=../../../../22http/incarnanet/host/kelly-berger/char/character-ideas/adron-wylkes/original-adron/22_2084268617.html rel=\"nofollow\">Read More \u2192<\/a>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"parent":3921,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":[],"categories":[],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/3922"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3922"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/3922\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":3923,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/3922\/revisions\/3923"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/3921"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3922"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3922"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3922"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
