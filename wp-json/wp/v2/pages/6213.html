It is comprised of adventures, encounters, and scenes that build on a main plot line, involve multiple subplots and consistent non-player characters. The main plots are: a trade dispute between two interests; a weak and sickly baron, unsupportive of his Lord\u2019s (the Earl of Bar-Innis) attempt to stabilize and improve the area; and a resurgence of perils with a recently uncovered ancient ruins. A series of events has conspired to place the locals of the barony square in the sites of turmoil and violence. <\/p>\n<p>Within this, several sub plots provide many opportunities for glory and treasure. The affable merchant and smuggler Lucky Red Scarf is expanding his influence. Meddling by the League of the White Lily trying to change the culture of the larger earldom the barony is in. Arrayed against them is the whispered-about Twin Rivers Shadow Council. Other creatures and characters, drawn in by the magic of an ancient enclave, have come to carve out their own fortunes. <\/p>\n<div class=\"bordered\"><a href=../../../../22/play/adventure/steel-realms-adventures/dunstrand-rising/22_185736049.html title=\"Steel Realms - Dunstrand Rising (A Living World Campaign)\"><img src=../../../../22/wp-content/uploads/srlm-lv-dunstrise-e1521505152397png/index_539322423.html alt=\"Steel Realms - Dunstrand Rising (A Living World Campaign)\" \/><\/a>This materials is part of a Living World campaign setting.

The treacherous Scar Flow and Dwindor Swamp limit boat movement to only those who know the swamp well and have precious cargo. Every boat north of the barony on the coast is more of a barge or skiff. Crestwold\u2019s port is up one tributary of a river that spills out into Scar Flow, where there is enough solid land to maintain a breakwater and docks. Its small trade port bring in goods from Tarmysia, Umbak, and Loamwold mostly. Since the war, few open sea merchant vessels have come this far &#8211; and there is only room for a single large ship in the port besides. For all of its out-of-the-way flavor and limits, Crestwold is uniquely positioned to be a focal point. In better times, the population was double, goods flowed, and the barony enjoyed a unique relationship with its halfling neighbors. Since the civil war, and Berithors (the previous Earl of Bar-Innis) decrees, trade with the halflings dropped off, goods barely moved, and folk left in great numbers after the war. Such was the price of neutrality in the civil war of the Earldom. It is at its lowest civil ebb in decades. It is ready to come out of its shell.\n<\/p>\n<ul class=\"su-subpages pageList\"><li class=\"page_item page-item-7967\"><a
