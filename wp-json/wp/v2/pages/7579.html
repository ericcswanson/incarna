PCs may be able to use them as a resource, though they are not prone to accepting outsider druids into their Briarwood. They view nearly everyone as a threat. The Witch of Dwindor is a sometime ally, and sometime foe. There is so much ancient magic in the old vale that its a constant job to tract what dangers may be lurking in the depths of Scar Flow, Calibans Slurry, and Dwindor Swamp.\n<\/p>\n<p>The Druids will observe and watch the PCs through their natural agents. They will always have a general idea of where they are (within 10 miles) and events triggered by them. They prefer to mostly let events unfold as they may, unless nature itself is threatened.\n<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Leadership\"><\/span>Leadership<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Adella is a woman who has been in the Moorswood since a young age. She is nearly 50 now, and leads the small Briarwood in defending nature. She is not terribly politically savvy. She will realize that the direct attacks by Gwinn are, in the long term, bad for the people and nature of Crestwold. She will choose to work with the PCs in most cases with only a small effort to persuade her needed. She has a single attendant.\n<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Briarwood_of_Pranin_Moorswood\"><\/span>Briarwood of Pranin Moorswood<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>There are three other druids in the Moorswood. Each of them has an attendant of either human or half elf. Each has a faithful watcher &#8211; a natural creature that always follows them. The Briarwood is a dark place, deep in the heart of the Moorswood. It is a place of great power, though the circle there prefers to keep that fact hidden &#8211; even from other druids. The Briarwood sits on the ruins of a Bronzemen Megalith which was used to focus wind and sky energy.\n<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"What_the_Druids_Know\"><\/span>What the Druids Know<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><Gwinn<\/b>:\n<\/p>\n<p><b>Bronzemen<\/b>:\n<\/p>\n<p><b>Calibans Slurry<\/b>:\n<\/p>\n<p><b>The Black Shore<\/b>:\n<\/p>\n<p><b>The Moorswood<\/b>:\n<\/p>\n<p><b>Bella<\/b>:\n<\/p>\n<p><b>Witch of Dwindor<\/b>:\n<\/p>\n<p><b>Phantom Soldiers<\/b>:\n<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Other_Moorswood_Information\"><\/span>Other Moorswood Information<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<ul class=\"su-subpages pageList\"><li class=\"page_item page-item-7669\"><a href=../../../../22http/incarnanet/play/adventure/steel-realms-adventures/dunstrand-rising/transformation-crestwold/characters/druid-pranin/weakening/22_2084319561.html>Weakening the Druids of Pranin Moorswood (Adventure)<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Although there are no direct plot threads with the druids, they can be a valuabel ally.
