The townsfolk are very happy that we vanquished the spirit.  The elves come and resume relations with the humans.<br \/>\nWe are resting in the inn when a Sprite comes and perches on Modax\u2019s shoulder.  She drops leaves into his hands and they shrivel and turn black.  Meena sees they are in the shape of ravens.<br \/>\nThe Mayor tells us they are a summons to the Stones of Ravenwood, which is about a 2 day walk.<br \/>\nWe rest more and are given provisions.  We head out and feel as though we are being watched.<br \/>\nWe see 2 large stones in the shape of ravens.  They represent the peace of the elves and we feel safe.  Drayfala says this place is protected.<br \/>\nWhile we sleep, we have strange feelings of vertigo, and restlessness.  Some of us are still effected after we wake.<br \/>\nWhen we break camp, a beautiful elven woman comes into camp and spreads leaves on the grounds, she then fades into the fog.  The leave begin to stir. They blow away.<br \/>\nWe gather some of the leaves and realize they have words on them but they are jumbled.  They begin to wither in our hands.  We lay them back on the ground.<br \/>\nA hot wind and moaning sound comes from the forest.  The wind starts to blow all the leaves away.<br \/>\nDrafala hears laughter from the forest from between the Ravenstone.  He walks between the stones and vanishes.<br \/>\nThe rest of the party follows Drafala between the Ravenstones.  We are met with a wall of thorns in a dark world.  The stars are above.  We see a clearing and a figure comes towards us.  It says \u201cWho Goes there.  I will kill you\u201d.<br \/>\nDrayfala hears our exchange.  He casts light, but nothing happens.  He speaks in Sylvan.  \u201cIt is Drayfala, this is a magical force and we can only speak to each other in Sylvan\u201d<br \/>\nAs we get closer, the creature gets smaller and we realize its Drayfala.  He and Meena can speak Sylvan.  Drayfala tries to speak Elvish to Meena.  She screams in agony and takes psychic damage.   The rest of the party cannot understand us.  We will try and communicate with signs.<br \/>\n1 Fight, no magic<br \/>\n2 Fight with everything<br \/>\n3 Retreat<br \/>\n4 Hide<br \/>\n5 Pause<br \/>\nModax tries a Prestidigitation spell and it seems to work.<br \/>\nWe move to a clearing surrounded by thorn walls.  We see the night sky above.  There is a tunnel that leads into the distance.<br \/>\nWe feel dizzy for a moment.  The party clears their heads, except for Modax, who is still under vertigo.<br \/>\nFrom the darkness come 4 balls of thorns at us.<br \/>\nBalder attacks two of the balls that come at him.<br \/>\nMeena attacks with her swords, hitting one.<br \/>\nModax hits the same one with Magic Missiles and it blows up.  Meena and Talia are able to dodge out of the way of the thorns.<br \/>\nDrayfala casts Ray of fire and one of them burns up.<br \/>\nThe balls attack but miss.<br \/>\nBalder attacks hitting.<br \/>\nMeena attacks, destroying the other on her side.<br \/>\nTalia moves to the other side and attacks with her rapier, blowing up another ball.<br \/>\nModax casts Ray of Frost for minimal damage.<br \/>\nThe ball attacks Drayfala.<br \/>\nDrayfala casts Firebolt hitting the last ball, destroying it.<br \/>\nA large branch comes out of a tree and hits Drayfala.  A creature jumps off the branch in front of the party.  It has spines and flies.<br \/>\nThe creature flies past Dray and stabs him with a fork as he flies past.<br \/>\nBalder attacks, hitting the tree.<br \/>\nMeena hits the tree with both swords.<br \/>\nTalia shoots at the flying creature, critting it.<br \/>\nModax misses with his Ray of Frost.<br \/>\nDrayfala hits it with a Firebolt.<br \/>\nThe creature hits Talia with a spine and fire.<br \/>\nThe tree attacks Meena, but misses.<br \/>\nBalder hits the tree with her great axe.  The tree falls.<br \/>\nMeena shoots at the flying devil, hitting it.<br \/>\nTalia also shoots it.<br \/>\nModax shoots it with a Magic Missile.<br \/>\nThe creature shoots its last spikes and attacks the party, as it falls and dies.<br \/>\nDrayfala heals the party.<br \/>\nWe proceed down the next path.  It is dark and we have the vertigo feeling again.  For a moment, Drayfala feels close to his deity, but then it goes away.  He says a prayer of consecration, but it has no effect.<br \/>\nModax again continues to feel vertigo.  He is sick.<br \/>\nWe are in a place of dust.  We are attacked by tumbleweeds.<br \/>\nMeena hits one with her sword.<br \/>\nDrayfala casts Firebolt, but misses.<br \/>\nBalder hits one and it blows up.<br \/>\nBalder and Drayfala are hit by bits of tumbleweed.  Drayfala is blinded by the dust.<br \/>\nTalia attacks with a rapier, missing it.<br \/>\nModax hits for minimal damage with a Ray of Frost.<br \/>\n The weeds attack hitting Meena but missing Talia.<br \/>\nA living tree comes from behind a bush and attacks Meena.<br \/>\nMeena drinks a potion of healing.<br \/>\nDrayfala heals Meena.<br \/>\nBalderdash crits on the tree.<br \/>\nModax hits one of the Tumbleweeds with Ray of Frost.<br \/>\nThe tumbleweeds attack Modax but miss.  The tree attacks him, hitting him.<br \/>\nA dust Mephit blows dust at us.  Only Drayfala is blinded again.<br \/>\nMeena attacks the tree, hitting both times.<br \/>\nDrayfala casts Lesser Restoration on himself, and he can see again.<br \/>\nBalder attacks the tree, hitting it.<br \/>\nTalia shoots at the dust mephit, hitting it.<br \/>\nModax hits a tumbleweed with Ray of Frost, destroying it.<br \/>\nTalia is partially blinded.<br \/>\nA tumbleweed attacks Balder, but it misses.<br \/>\nThe tree attacks Balder missing him.<br \/>\nThe mephit attacks Talia, hitting her.<br \/>\nMeena misses her attacks on the tree.<br \/>\nDrayfala casts Firebolt, but it misses.<br \/>\nBalder misses his attacks.<br \/>\nTalia attacks the Mephit, but misses.<br \/>\nModax misses his Ray of Frost on the tree.<br \/>\nThe tree attacks Balder, critting him.<br \/>\nThe tumbleweed misses.<br \/>\nMeena misses.<br \/>\nDrayfala hits the tumbleweed with a Firebolt.<br \/>\nBalder attacks the tree, hitting it.  Then he uses his second wind to heal himself.  The tree falls, dead.<br \/>\nTalia hits the mephit.<br \/>\nModax hits the mephit with a Ray of Frost, killing it.  It blows up causing dust to blow.<br \/>\nMeena gets dust in her eyes and it partially blind.<br \/>\nMeena misses her attacks.<br \/>\nBalder attacks the last Tumbleweed, hitting it and taking it down.<br \/>\nDrayfala takes out the elven wine and throws it in Meena\u2019s eyes.  She can see finally.<br \/>\nWe decide to rest.   We rest and heal back up.<br \/>\nWe are attacked\u2026<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>World of Ph&#8217;yrin Tys! 12\/2\/15 Game Master = Kelly Berger We go back to town and heal up.
