After years of working for the Council of Cerran\u2019s Grant &#8211; and most believe the twin river powers to the north &#8211; the wizard Anwin has announced he will retire to private life. The lavish remnant of the guardhouse above the dry river bed that he occupies will go up for sale. Over the years its been the scene of a few conflicts, but in the last decade or so, it has become increasingly busy as the council has relied on it as a base of operations to consolidate its power in the area. Anwin has said he takes no side personally in the ongoing struggles of the Riverdan folk, and wishes everyone prosperity. He has repeatedly sided against traditional concerns in his tenure as the \u201cconsultant\u201d of the council and used his power to lend weight to the council\u2019s decisions. Anwin\u2019s departure in 3 months will leave the council with a distinct lack of effective power and presence. It is said that the council is seeking to employ one or more lesser wizards to fill in his stead. Anwin has not said where he will retire to, but likely a more warmer clime &#8211; the Vale Evander it is speculated.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Hear-Ye! Hear-Ye!
