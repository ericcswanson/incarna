The Cerstwhile family can trace its origins back 1000 years in the region &#8211; though not always as the Baron, as they have been for 700 years. They began as a cavalier branch of a Riverdan family through marriage to one of the daughters of Sira Derrick Hogon. The Hogons came from Bar-Innis, in the northern reaches somewhere. The lineage is sure to go back further in the region, but it was only at the point where they gained notoriety and some land that it becomes concrete. <\/p>\n<p>It is a quiet place in the SW corner of the earldom of Bar-Innis where nothing ever happens and there are no real opportunities. It has good roads (though few), and is mostly self sufficient and little exports outside of its own lands. It does have one of the only passenger ports out of Dunstrand outside of Bar-Innis and the baronies of Tarmysia &#8211; the the port is mostly a trade port and small. There is a minor military presence, but the buildings are old and little expense is made to keep them staffed.\n<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Notable_Events_and_Happenings\"><\/span>Notable Events and Happenings<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><b>Adventures Referenced<\/b>: <a href=../../../../22http/incarnanet/play/adventure/steel-realms-adventures/apshai/ashfall-uncovered/22_404163867.html title=\"\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"\" class=\"\">Ashfall Uncovered<\/a>, <a href=../../../../22http/incarnanet/play/adventure/steel-realms-adventures/dunstrand-rising/transformation-crestwold/22_2115979278.html title=\"\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"\" class=\"\">Transformation of Crestwold (Campaign Arc)<\/a>\n<\/p>\n<h4><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"After_Harvest_Faire_of_Ezrilus\"><\/span>After Harvest Faire of Ezrilus<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n<p><b>The Red Reed Feast<\/b> &#8211; Each year, towards the end of the year in the fall, there is a large gathering on the Red Reed Plane about 5 miles from the Broken Switch Inn &#8211; its a flat raised large field and nothing grows nearby but scrub and [red] reeds (in the fall &#8211; they are normal by winter). Its up against the hills at the end of Lake Greflan, and there is a strange natural amphitheater. Its the largest of the fall festivals in southern Bar-Innis. Acting troupes, entertainers, bards, and common folk gather from all around. The Baron of Crestwold pays for a great deal of the food and mead. Its four days of celebration and feasting. The highlight is the pugilist tournament &#8211; it runs all four days, with those who wish to participate coming 1-2 days early to qualify. From 4-5 baronies, the pugilist experts come to win &#8211; the prize is always a horse and 5 gold coins, plus whatever winnings can be made from gambling.\n<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Places_and_Items_of_Interest\"><\/span>Places and Items of Interest<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<ul class=\"su-subpages pageList\"><li class=\"page_item page-item-6327\"><a href=../../../../22http/incarnanet/verse/set/steel-realms/places/heartlands/central/dunstrand/bar-innis/crestwold/red-bone-monastery/22_2036664835.html>Red Bone Monastery<\/a><\/li>\n<li class=\"page_item page-item-7325\"><a href=../../../../22http/incarnanet/verse/set/steel-realms/places/heartlands/central/dunstrand/bar-innis/crestwold/point-saril/22_1059940699.html>Point Saril<\/a><\/li>\n<li class=\"page_item page-item-6384\"><a href=../../../../22http/incarnanet/verse/set/steel-realms/places/heartlands/central/dunstrand/bar-innis/crestwold/caverns-bromei/22_522089275.html>Caverns of Bromei<\/a><\/li>\n<li class=\"page_item page-item-6340\"><a href=../../../../22http/incarnanet/verse/set/steel-realms/places/heartlands/central/dunstrand/bar-innis/crestwold/torrelsons-ford/22_1259552829.html>Torrelsons Ford<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Features\"><\/span>Features<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<h4><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Sabin_Bay\"><\/span>Sabin Bay<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n<p>The bay is full of sharp rocks and treacherous sand bars and tides.

It is a marshy, salty place where tide flows and fresh water meet and mix.\n<\/p>\n<p><b>Black Shore Road<\/b>: The road is used only in the summer when things are very dry. Several attempts have been made to put a caravan way station along here and none have succeeded. The road is an old trade route, and there are several ruins of settlements off its path. The road is under water in several spots most of the year.\n<\/p>\n<ul class=\"flat\">\n<li>Sunfri Spur: This is the old road, long fallen into disrepair. It is overgrown and covered in standing water in parts. Travelers are warned to stay away because of the Moor Cats and bandits that are said to make their home here.<\/li>\n<li>Road Post of Brawin Round: This is along abandoned road post for guards from Torrelsons Ford. It was meant as a stable and forward warning post in times of war but it fell into disrepair and now its collapsing. It consists of a main building, an a stone long hall meant to have an additional 10&#8242; tower on it. It has a massive stone fire pit as a warning beacon, cracked and filled with water now.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><b>Steadings<\/b>: A few places have consistent dry land. Enterprising families have created a few steadings over the last several hundred years.

Used to be called Nenrils Ridge. The broken Nerril Tower ruins sits atop it to the north, slowly being pulled down the ridge by mud slides. High on the crags above Postdam Falls is the old Red Bone Monastery at the south end of the ridge. The territories of Krellian comprise most of this area.\n<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Yarans_Vale\"><\/span>Yarans Vale<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>At one time, Umbak had a foothold in the barony, and the capital was Yarans Vale. There was a large clash of armies, and the Umbakains were driven out, and eventually driven out of all their steadings &#8211; including those in Loamwald territory. It is a lonely feeling place, where the wind blows over the ruins of Umbakian villages and the town of Helmandal &#8211; once the seat of Umbakian power. It is said that the soil of the vale is blood soaked and cursed &#8211; the soldiers of Umbak and Dunstrand Vale forever locked in mortal combat. Strange lights are seen in the vale &#8211; folks whisper that these are the souls of the soldiers.\n<\/p>\n<p><b>Point Saril<\/b>: <a href=../../../../22http/incarnanet/verse/set/steel-realms/places/heartlands/central/dunstrand/bar-innis/crestwold/point-saril/22_1059940699.html title=\"\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"\" class=\"\">Point Saril<\/a> was once a town and way station for merchants when the area was under Umbakian rule. A lighthouse was even put in, to help those lost in the moors of the Black Shore find their way. Almost all sits abandoned and avoided now. Moor Cats are known to prowl nearby.\n<\/p>\n<p><b>Gnaefor Ridge<\/b>: A ridge line that was a natural break, dividing the area of the barony in half. At the top of it once stood Helmandi Keep &#8211; the source of power for Umbak in the regions. It now lies in ruins. Part of the ridge line collapsed hundreds of years ago, taking down part of the wall. It is avoided, though sometimes adventurers seek it out.

The church of Balthazaar built right at the crossroads has been dedicated to that god, Aerna, and Gaia over the ages. Its stone foundations have held against several sieges as a refuge for commoners in times of trouble. The graveyard of the Umbakians is still sometimes visited by pilgrims and the mausoleum of the Strayol family has been converted to a shrine to Aerna.\n<\/p>\n<p>Haridsen Vale: Although this is technically considered part of the fief of Krellian, it is inhabited almost entirely by halflings.
