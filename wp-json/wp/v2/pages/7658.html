Huran, the hill giant king, led his tribe through the Dew Gate, from the Feywild into the area of the Riverdans. A mischievous pixie taunted him, stole a personal item, and led him on a chase to the gate, evading his grasp. The pixie served the Unseelie Fey, and was stirring up trouble &#8211; this was a planned act. Angered, the giant collected his tribe to retrieve their sacred object, and discovered an area on the other side of the gate where there was few soldiers, and many settlers to plunder and eat. After several battles, dozens of deaths and countless wounded, the giant king was slain. The last of his blood, which would not dry and could not be burnt such was its hate, was captured into a vial by druids and blessed and buried with his bones to seal the gateway to the Feywild. That was thousands of years ago, it was mostly forgotten and passed into local legend. A shrine to the Green Church was built over the site, which eventually became a temple.\n<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"The_Coming_of_the_Necromancer\"><\/span>The Coming of the Necromancer<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Zturahk the Old (who left the message at the temple ruins) stumbled onto some ancient references in literature. An itinerant necromancer, Zturahk is descended from an ancient Gwinnish mage house, but struck out on his own in 8641. He was disgraced and wandered, researching and using necromancy to extend his life far beyond its natural span. He studied among the houses of the dead in Ados. He is also bitter &#8211; extremely bitter &#8211; toward the world of youth and beauty, and hates the advancement of time and age. As such, in spitefulness, he from time to time plants &#8220;seeds of death&#8221;: small magical effects or changes to a place that sometimes take root and slowly rot the place from the inside. Such was his creation of the skeleton king and its poisoning of the Athla Hill Country. The skeleton king Huran\u2019s blood was used to animate his bones. The Dew Gate to the Feywild was reopened, though its power also kept the animation of Huran from going anywhere.\n<\/p>\n<div><b>Motivations<\/b>: He hates places of beauty, fertility, youth, and such, like the Athla Hill Country. He came from the south, doing several similar things. <\/div>\n<div><b>Fate<\/b>: House Malor was able to track him down, confront him, and slay him in 9130 as he began to stir things up in Dwindor Swamp better left undisturbed.\n<\/div>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Becoming_the_Grim_Downs\"><\/span>Becoming the Grim Downs<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>The &#8220;seeds of death&#8221; magics of the necromancer with the blood of Huran on a site of a gate to the Feywild triggered a series of events that lead to the skeleton of the giant Huran being animated, the gate reopened, and many strange events that has driven the locals away. Almost 50 years ago strange mists began to permanently settle in the valleys of the rolling grazing lands. The river was slowly taken over by a constant fog after 10 years, leaving all trade by land. People vanished in the mist, and it was avoided by all. Orrish raiders became a constant pain at night, and most of the population of the hills were forced to move out after larger creatures began to appear over time. The last straw was the winter solstice of 9131, when many cemeteries disgorged the bones of buried ancestors and skeletal remains attacked the churches, killing the priests of the Wyld Faith and the last strong defense in the area. Since then, strange creatures are rumored to walk the area &#8211; even giants, which vanished long ago. Over the last few years, many have braved the region seeking treasure left behind by those that fled\u2026 but they do not return.\n<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Part_1_Afon_Ddu\"><\/span>Part 1: Afon Ddu<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Author: Eric Swanson 2019<br \/>\n(aa-von thee &#8211; The Heart of Dorkness)<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Background\/Story\"><\/span>Background\/Story<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>(Timeline reminder from previous adventures: After returning from the Feywild the party was back in Zerburre; they spent the first day recovering, with headaches, mild hallucinations, and general negative effects from travelling to the fey.

(This can be managed without incident and could be done by riverboat if the party wants to look for one.) The land here is generally flat, the wide low country of the lower Vale of Dunstrand. The Nanford River spurs winds slowly through this region, mostly devoid of rapids or impediments, between muddy banks. On the south side of the river a region of low hills &#8211; the Athla Hill country or \u2018Grimdowns\u2019 &#8211; rises; but the north side of the river is flat farming country, mostly deforested but for the occasional small wood or copse.\n<\/p>\n<p>See <a href=../../../../22http/incarnanet/play/adventure/ancient-blood/up-the-grim-downs/beedel/22_509174139.html title=\"\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"\" class=\"\">Beedel Transforms<\/a>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"The_Athla_River_Route\"><\/span>The Athla River Route<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<h4><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Floating_Corpse\"><\/span>Floating Corpse<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n<h4><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Skeletons_Hanging\"><\/span>Skeletons Hanging<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n<h4><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"The_GoblinMonkeys\"><\/span>The Goblin-Monkeys<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n<h4><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Goblins\"><\/span>Goblins<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n<h4><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Hobgoblins\"><\/span>Hobgoblins<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n<h4><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"River_Bend_Hill_Giant\"><\/span>River Bend Hill Giant<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n<div><b>Corpse of the Giant<\/b>:\n<\/div>\n<h4><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"The_Stone_Bridge\"><\/span>The Stone Bridge<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Ruins_of_Kindredale\"><\/span>Ruins of Kindredale<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<h4><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"The_Safe_Shore\"><\/span>The Safe Shore<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n<h4><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"The_Abandoned_Docks\"><\/span>The Abandoned Docks<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n<h4><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Shrine_of_the_Green_Church\"><\/span>Shrine of the Green Church<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Part_2_Removing_the_Grim\"><\/span>Part 2: Removing the Grim<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Author: Kelly Berger; 2019-2020<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Ancient Blood &#8211; Secrets of the Riverdans Author: Eric Swanson and Kelly Berger2014 History Dew Gate Opened in Ancient Times A band of settlers to the area disturbed an ancient archway built by the Druunad, a Dew Gate to the Feywild.
