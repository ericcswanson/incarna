Eera starts down the west corridor.  She comes to a room with a cave in and lots of rubble.<br \/>\nWe work at clearing out the rubble, at Eera\u2019s request.  After 10 hours, we are exhausted and we are no closer to finding out what caused the collapse.<br \/>\nWe take a long rest.<br \/>\nWe go down the East corridor, Eera in the lead.  We find a room that is partially flooded with ice covering the water.  There is a Sun Lord alter with a large Elk upon the altar, which is frosted.<br \/>\nEera approaches the altar and finds a gold amulet of the Sun Lord.  She gives it to Singin to look at.  Eera thanks the elk for its gifts and takes the elks antlers.<br \/>\nSingen gives the amulet to Meena to keep as party treasure.<br \/>\nEera finds a secret door.  It is unlocked.  Singen goes in to the room and finds 3 goblins.<br \/>\nDulug shoots at Singen for 4 pts.<br \/>\nGrog attacks Singen with a scimitar, missing.<br \/>\nSinjin casts Sleep.  Two of the three fall asleep.  Then he moves back into the other room.  With a bonus action he casts Bardic Inspiration on Alta.<br \/>\nMeena tries to shoot with her longbow, but misses.<br \/>\nEera uses a thorn whip and hits Grog.<br \/>\nGrog crits Eera.<br \/>\nMeena misses again.<br \/>\nSinjin hits with his bow.<br \/>\nMeena finally hits for 6 pts.<br \/>\nEera attacks and takes out Grog.  We also kill the other goblins.<br \/>\nIt looks like they have been living in this room.  There is an altar with the skeleton of a boar.  Eera takes the boar\u2019s skull.<br \/>\nWe find on the goblins:<br \/>\nNice scimitar; a human eyeball; a potion of disguise self; a potion of haste; 14 GP.  We identify the scimitar as a +1 weapon the goblins called \u201cDog Slicer\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>Eera heads down the next passage way.  There is a secret door.  Eera hears scratching on the far side and tells the party about it.  She prepares a spell.  She opens the door.  It is dark.  She enters the room.  In the room is a large skeleton of a wolf.<br \/>\nAlta enters the room and attacks the skeleton.  She uses her Bardic Insp. to hit. And she hits on a second attack.<br \/>\nMeena hits twice with her swords.<br \/>\nEera takes him out.<br \/>\nThe altar in this room is covered in rubble.  Eera takes the wolf\u2019s skull.<br \/>\nWe go through the main door and go into the room with the 7 doors.   We have checked one side.<br \/>\nWe check the room at 11:00, but it won\u2019t open.  We believe it is the room that we cleared the rubble from.<br \/>\nThe door at 9:00 only opens a crack.<br \/>\nSinjin unlocks the door at 7:00, but it only opens a crack.<br \/>\nWe move to the stairs, heading down.  Sinjin leads us down.  We come to a stone door with a sun on it.  Sinjin suggests we try fitting the amulet in it.  It fits, and the door slides open taking the amulet with it.<br \/>\nThere are urns, a couple treasure chests and weapons and armor lying about.<br \/>\nSinjin moves into the room checking for traps.  He moves towards an urn.  We hear the sound of bone against stone.<br \/>\nMeena moves into the room and crits one of the skeletons.<br \/>\nA skeleton hits Sinjin.  Another hits him as well.  He is down.<br \/>\nEena moves into the room and casts Thunderwave.  Two of the skeletons collapse.  The other two and the rest of the party are injured and blown 10 feet back.<br \/>\nMeena moves next to Sinjin and casts Cure Wounds, awakening him.<br \/>\nSinjin casts True Strike on Alta.  She attacks and takes out a skeleton.  She moves to the last skeleton and hits him too.<br \/>\nEera hits the skeleton and he crumbles.<br \/>\nWe do some healing and then take a long rest.<br \/>\nWe check the room for traps and check out the chests.  One of them is empty, as is the other.  The armor and weapons are rusty and ruined.<br \/>\n212 G; 230 S; 4 pearls (100 G); Longbow (old style) in perfect condition.  The vases have no dust on them.  They are empty.<br \/>\nSinjin identifies the Longbow as a +1 Longbow (Sinjin) using one of the pearls.<br \/>\nSinjin tells us the vases are glowing slightly.  They are trolls that have had a transformation spell put on them about 1000 years ago.  They have been conscience and they have a 15 Intelligence.    Eera throws hers overboard.  Meena keeps hers for now.<\/p>\n<p>We find a chink in the wall and find a ring.  It is a Life ring with a sun, star, and moon on it.  It gives you 20 temp hit pts when worn.<br \/>\nWe take our treasure and make our way back out of the mountain.  We head back to the lake where the ship is waiting.<br \/>\nEera buries the remains of the sacrifices.<br \/>\nWe board the ship and we head out.<br \/>\nWe meet with Spider Braz.  He is pleased with our efforts.   He pays us the 500 GP each.<br \/>\nMeena gives 100 GP to her family in town.<br \/>\nSinjin buys a breast plate.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>World of Ph&#8217;yrin Tys!
