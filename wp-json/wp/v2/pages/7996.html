His eyes were also a flashing light blue &#8211; nothing like the dark blue eyes of other Umbakians. As a 2nd son of his father\u2019s first wife he stood to inherit much. However, he was skipped over, officially written out of the family succession because of his perceived impurity. He was raised on the sea though, like his siblings and cousins, to be a sailor. He is at home more on sea than land, and more at home with his nose in a book than other people\u2019s business. Being ostracized meant he spent a lot of time with books and learning about the world beyond the borders of the kingdom. And, when he became of age, his father gave him an inheritance to provide for his education. In a move to get slight revenge upon his family who had written him off, he penned a letter to the head of a bardic order in the duchy of Dunstrand &#8211; Umbak\u2019s rival neighbor to the north. He left his family and traveled to the Malorian Academy there when he was 14. He studied for 4 years, and served for another 4 years around the central heartlands for the order, interacting with the High King\u2019s bards, settling trade disputes, and fulfilling the business of House Malor. He achieved some measure of skill in magic &#8211; something he knew would upset his parents and relatives. The entire time, he wrote as if he were studying to be a sage in the capital or Oerdney, creating an elaborate system of letter paths and contacts to fool them. After he made a small reputation for himself under the name of Alcott Traveler, he received word that though he was removed from succession, he must still serve the obligatory time in the Umbakian military before he was 30. He leveraged his reputation to enter The Sheltering Brotherhood of defenders. They knew his name and background, and with a letter of recommendation from the Malorian Academy, he began his studies to be a holy warrior of Whelm. He spent the next 7 years in devoted study and martial defense of the hills and farmlands around southern Dunstrand\/northern Fandelok.\n<\/p>\n<p>At the age of 25, he returned home to serve his time in the military. His family\u2019s final contribution to his livelihood was to purchase a captain&#8217;s commission for him. Alcott served for 10 years in the Umbakian navy. His commission as a captain got him in, but it was soon clear he was a natural tactician and sailor. He chafed under the strict regimen of his countrymen, for him the war with imperial Gwinn was a godsend. He sold his commission in the navy, and bought himself a swift ship. Before his family\u2019s honor was decreased by his actions, he used their name to get loans to outfit the ship. His previous connections got him a privateer contract on the Queen\u2019s Coast of Umbak (north). For three years he terrorized the Gwinnish shipping. It was not the Gwinnish that finally brought him low, it was his own hubris. He chose to use a storm as cover for his hunting, got caught up in it, and lost his ship. His name was ruined. He paid his debts from his gains, and fell into a bottle of cheap wine. He\u2019s been looking for a way to redeem himself in his own eyes.\n<\/p>\n<p>Offered by the Blackwells via Lucky.
