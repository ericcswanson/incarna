A type of smith who specializes in the crafting of metal armor components, including rivots, buckles, studs, grommets, lames, chainmail, and even plate components.<\/p>\n<p>From Monaides (Riverdan). He was originally meant to be an armorers apprentice, but there was not enough work.<br \/>\nHe was forced to leave. He went to county Faer and no one wanted a &#8220;bumpkin apprentice&#8221;. He ended up in Umbak, where his accent was just one from Dunstrand. There he managed to get a job as a groomsman for a Silver Talent knight named Erick Silvershine. A young knight, with bright armor that Asginaud kept polished. He traveled with him to the merchant cities for 2 years. <\/p>\n<p>He took initiation into the ranks of the followers of Balthazaar, like his master. After 3 more years, he pledged his sword to the cause, as a squire and paladin to Balthazaar. His master was killed seeking out a necromancer in Poelitz. His body was animated and it took a dozen down before it was torn to pieces. He lost his faith. He joined a mercenary band. He had his master&#8217;s spear. He fought, there were drugs in his food stores, he went mad. He scourged himself raw in his drug madness, rather than fight; this is how he survived at Hotherwale. <\/p>\n<p>One is Asginaud &#8211; from somewhere in the Riverdans (heavy accent) and has his back covered in scars. He looks like hes spent a lot of time in the saddle. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Human, Fighter 2nd Fallen Paladin HP: 6,6=12 + 4 = 16 Strength: 14 Intelligence: 11 Wisdom: 13 Dexterity: 12 Constitution: 15 Charisma: 14 Sanity: 12 Description: 5&#8217;9&#8243;, medium build, #179; blonde hair, brown eyes, male Took a Vow of Poverty &#8211; really does not care for material things much, lives cheaply and simply Proficiency @+2 [&hellip;]<\/p>\n<a role=\"link\" class=\"rtp-readmore\" title=\"Read more on Asginaud\" href=../../../../22http/incarnanet/host/kelly-berger/char/asginaud/22_190142793.html rel=\"nofollow\">Read More \u2192<\/a>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"parent":326,"menu_order":27,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":[],"categories":[],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/6349"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=6349"}],"version-history":[{"count":2,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/6349\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":6350,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/6349\/revisions\/6350"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/326"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=6349"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=6349"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=6349"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
