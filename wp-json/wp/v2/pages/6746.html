He grew up on a boat, working with his uncle and aunts business trading with the merchant cities of the south. He was employed by the merchant cities for years on fast frigates, blockade runners, and pirate quashing. He was a mercenary on the privateers of Umbak, making his way north. The Gwinnish, in some sleek new war sloop design, ambushed them and killed the entire crew, sinking his boat. Only one other survived. He floated at sea on debris for three days. He was picked up by a halfling coastal fishing boat, and brought to a village in Loamwold. After rehabing for a week there, a halfling captain named Lucky Red Scarf stopped in for supplies and took him to Torrelsons Ford. Eventually he ended up in south Dunstrand, looking to take a few month off and rest before journeying even further north to see the world. He became a dock worker after helping protect halfling merchants sailing into Torrelsons Ford in the barony of Crestwold of Bar-Innis in Dunstrand. He reoutfitted himself &#8211; staying away from drink and spending money on anything but his professional image for months.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Race: Human > 5&#8217;11&#8221;, male, right handed, black hair (short; trimmed beard), tanned skin, age: 20, blue eyes, #145 Scar: left shoulder &#8211; gaff hook from Gwinnish marine; shark bit left leg Behaviors: fastidiously groomed Class: Fighter 2nd Hit Points: 20 Strength: 12 Intelligence: 12 Wisdom: 14 Dexterity: 17 Constitution: 14 Charisma: 12 Sanity: 13 [&hellip;]<\/p>\n<a role=\"link\" class=\"rtp-readmore\" title=\"Read more on Keldman Doff\" href=../../../../22http/incarnanet/host/nathan-adair/char/keldman-doff/22_1747460223.html rel=\"nofollow\">Read More \u2192<\/a>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"parent":4897,"menu_order":8,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":[],"categories":[],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/6746"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=6746"}],"version-history":[{"count":9,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/6746\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":6853,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/6746\/revisions\/6853"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/4897"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=6746"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=6746"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=6746"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
