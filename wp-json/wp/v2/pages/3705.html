At some point, she must venture forth on the journey into the world which will lead her to her daughter. What that journey might look like she has no expectations. She tends to find a place of easy defense, where a garden can be tended and goats raised. She speaks to the local animals, tends to their wounds and helps their young. In return they warn her of danger, and look over her son when she is tending the homestead. She raised a litter of pups, one of which is Granger (a powerful Shepard, trained for war by a she-wolf in exchange for saving one of her pup's life) and her son's favorite and watches over him and the homestead. He is 4 years old. She spent years mastering her bond with the Queen of the Feywild, and struggling to teach herself the powers of the book she had been given. When her son turned 5, on his birthday she was able to conjure forth a Sprite from the realm of faerie based on her limited mastery of the ritual book. The sprite became the playmate of her son, and taught her the rest of the rituals in the book. Shes has spent years honing her skills as a warrior-witch - she lacks the stamina and armor of a fighter, but not the spirit.\n<\/div>\r\n  <div id=\"char-story2\" class=\"tab-pane fade\">\r\n    <h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"A_story_of_growing_up\"><\/span>A story of growing up<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\r\nBorn in the country by homesteading parents, she raised herself after her parents died of the flu one seasons. Her father had been a soldier and a criminal and sewed distrust of all other people that has taken her years to get over - but her penchant for living alone never left her. She fled to the forest after her parents death and avoided all contact with others - this is really all she remembers of her early life. She was born somewhere in the years around 9130 somewhere in Dunstrand - her memories escape her. She had a sister at one point, but she was sent away. She remembers that there was a pale woman before her mother - and believes that her mother is not her real mother, or even that her parents are not her biological parents.\r\nAt the age of 13, she wandered into a faerie ring and into the Feywild. She remembers spending decades there, and nothing more, though she returned and was only age 18 and had with her a book written in ancient Elvish. Years later, after hiding in the woods for years and having little contact with others, she understood that she had gone backwards in time - that the current year was much earlier than the year she last remembered. She had a son (Bronislaus) and a daughter (Fiola) in the Feywild... but only the son came back with her. they both appear to be human, but she cannot remember their father, only the singing, dancing, and a smiling man's face. She remembers too the woman who rescued her from the tower she was \"imprisoned\" in (a velvet cage) - the maiden of the Summer Queen. In the court of the Summer Queen she was granted her freedom. She has raised her son herself with the power she found in the Feywild. She has a reputation as a healer and herbalist. She sings to herself and her son (who only speaks elvish fluently currently - by the time he was 1! - Gladnorian is only very basic) to pass the time, and her voice is terribly lonely and deep. She is sad as she searches for her lost daughter.\n\r\n  <\/div>\r\n  <div id=\"char-story3\" class=\"tab-pane fade\">\r\n    <h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"A_story_of_exemplifying_beliefs\"><\/span>A story of exemplifying beliefs<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\r\nHer current grove where her home is also has some confusion wired in - it borders on the Feywild, so it's hard to find the place unless you're invited or already familiar. She discovered the place after being chased by strange hounds in the forest - and seeking a refuge for her and her son she held him tight and crawled into a mass of brambles - nearly killing herself to protect him. She swore to the powers that would listen that she would gladly give her life if her son was spared. Strangely, the brambles closed about her and feral creatures could not get her. When the sun rose, the black hounds were still prowling about, but elk, bear, deer, and all manner of forest creature harassed them in battle after battle, and their anger and stamina was lessened by the sun and they were driven off. She promised the spirits of the land that day to look after the creatures - though no druid, she would tend their young, and protect them in exchange for the lives given that day. The lands of Dunstrand respond well to her singing, and her herbal gardens.\n\r\n  <\/div>\r\n  <div id=\"char-story4\" class=\"tab-pane fade\">\r\n    <h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"How_the_character_came_to_be_in_the_group\"><\/span>How the character came to be in the group<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\r\n\n\r\n  <\/div>\r\n  <div id=\"char-story5\" class=\"tab-pane fade\">\r\n    <h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"XP\/CP\/Inspirations_Gained_and_Spent\"><\/span><i class=\"fa fa-trophy\"><\/i> XP\/CP\/Inspirations Gained and Spent<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\r\nUp to 4th: Zero\r\nInspiration: 1\n\r\n  <\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\r\n\r\n<\/script>\r\n\n<hr \/>\n<p><b>CURRENT POSITION<\/b>: The tricks she learned in the Feywild she has perfected into the herbalist craft in the normal world.
