Also, its said he would give his last penny to help a brother of the company out.<br \/>\nTime in the Black Hounds: {6 years}<br \/>\n&#8211; Last rank in Black Hounds was Private\/New rank in Gallants is private<br \/>\nWhat are they known for > Pennies is known for being dependable &#8211; the man you can count on in combat to watch your back. He works best if teamed up with others&#8230; he is also known for being able to be stealthy and someone who can handle themselves in the city.<\/p>\n<p>Basics of Growing Up: [Nakrian] Worked as a merchant&#8217;s assistant in Beryl until the merchant was killed in Scrape on a mission there and he was forced to hide and flee in the city. Umbakian privateers intercepted his master Taramucci which was taking a contract and survey maps to Beryl, picking up from Gwinn via pirates in Scrape. He was taken on the docks after 2 weeks by a press gang and would have been a galley slave except he could read and write, and speak multiple languages. He served on a Scrapian pirate vessel for 2 years &#8211; learning to fight but mostly learning to protect himself and becoming a master with the shield (really the only &#8220;armor&#8221; he could afford); He bought his way off it in Poeltiz of the Merchant Cities with nothing to show but his freedom. <\/p>\n<p>Entry into the company: He came upon two drunks being beaten and robbed on the docks and helped them fend off their attackers. These were 2 of the Black Hounds (the 2 are now dead); Despite his empty hands he was given a chance to prove himself &#8211; all he asked for was a shield and club and he beat back 2 attackers at once. That gained him a place with the Black Hounds. His needs are simple and he was happy to make his way around the heartlands with a family that had saved him from dying in some back alley. <\/p>\n<p>Personality > I always want to know how things work and what makes people tick.<br \/>\nIdeal > Aspiration &#8211; I work hard to be the best there is at my craft (languages and contracts).<br \/>\nBond > I will get revenge on the evil forces that destroyed my place of business and ruined my livelihood.<br \/>\nFlaw > I would kill to acquire a title\/formal recognition or peerage.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Created: 8\/2017 by Kelly Berger Old Black Hound Company Nickname: &#8220;Pennies&#8221; Description: human, male; nakrian, black skin, right handed, 5&#8217;11&#8221;, #220, black hair\/corn rows CLASS: FIGHTER\/ROGUE (1st\/1st; ) Hit Points: 6, 5, +2 = 13 Strength 15 { +2 } Intelligence 10 {} Wisdom 12 { +1 } Dexterity 16 { +3 } Constitution 12 [&hellip;]<\/p>\n<a role=\"link\" class=\"rtp-readmore\" title=\"Read more on Abrama Tingata [Original]\" href=../../../../22http/incarnanet/host/kelly-royal/chars/abrama-tingata/orig/22_1064397338.html rel=\"nofollow\">Read More \u2192<\/a>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"parent":5545,"menu_order":14,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":[],"categories":[],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/5993"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=5993"}],"version-history":[{"count":2,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/5993\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":5995,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/5993\/revisions\/5995"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/5545"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=5993"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=5993"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=5993"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
