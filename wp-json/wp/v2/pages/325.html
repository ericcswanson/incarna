Use it. <\/li>\n<li>Commitment: The group will meet <b>every 2 weeks<\/b>. The online group will have posted events, but in your own calendar, you should assume every 2 weeks. This commitment must be matched to have a permanent character in the campaign. <\/li>\n<li>Caller: A <b>group representative<\/b> who will answer to the GM as the voice of authority when the GM needs to know what the party is going to do.<\/li>\n<li># Players: No more than <b>7 active players<\/b> (prefer 5-6 max) at any given session; exceptions may be made at GM discretion.

A lot of time and effort goes into planning scenarios and too many or too few causes a lot of extra worry and work for the GM to make things flow smoothly - please respect this and answer to invitations promptly, save the date and plan ahead.\">Respond: Confirm to whatever online calendar event is there so the host and GM can plan appropriately &#8211; If you do not and show up, the GM can force you to play an alternate character or NPC for the game session. Please call, message, and email if its last minute and you will not be able to make it though you have responded &#8216;yes&#8217; &#8211; we want to know you&#8217;re safe and not have to waste time waiting.<\/li>\n<li id=\"absent\">Absenteeism: Players who fail to show up for more than three consecutive sessions will have characters removed from the game in any way the GM sees fit &#8211; generally the tendency is to write spectacular deaths for characters who have ended their game-time.\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<hr \/>\n<h2 id=\"gspace\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"The_Gaming_Space\"><\/span>The Gaming Space<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The ONLY use for electronic devices is to manage the character sheet, make checks, and look up rules. Anything else is clutters the space and is a distraction and disrespectful to everyone else.<\/li>\n<li>Gathering: All parties shall gather around <b>a single central area<\/b> to participate as a group; exceptions can be made with space limitations but if there is space in a single place, use it. <\/li>\n<li>Sit with the group so that making checks can be observed and its easy for the GM to address the group. If its not possible (see gathering), make sure you can show those nearest the results of making checks if needed with a minimum of movement &#8211; i.e. roll on a book you can pass to the nearest player to witness. <\/li>\n<li>Clean Up: Help whoever hosts to <b>clean up dishes, trash, recycle<\/b> and anything else before you leave.<\/li>\n<li><b>Pets<\/b>: If the gathering is at a place with pets and you have strong allergies, skip on it if you can&#8217;t get meds or bear it out.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><b>Making checks<\/b>: You must have clearly marked indicators. If digital, the display must be viewable from all angles. All &#8220;dice&#8221; must have a high contrast between the numbers and background &#8211; i.e. white dice with black numbers. All resolution checks for players are to be made only on a character&#8217;s turn or when GM specifies, where people can see them. The spirit of this is to avoid questions of integrity and confusion in order of action, and make sure the GM and Party are all aware of each party members and opponents actions.\n<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>For % dice rolls, <b>there must be a distinct tens (with double digits) and ones (single digit) dice<\/b> or be declared ahead of the roll.<\/li>\n<li>If you have multiple attacks or multiple checks for the same thing done in one roll, specify which dice is first. A fumble generally precludes any more actions so you must be able to determine which order they resolve in. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2 id=\"charact\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Character_Actions_InGame\"><\/span>Character Actions In-Game<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<div class=\"know\" style=\"background-color: lightblue;\"><b>It is the players responsibility to know their character to the degree that keeps game play smooth.<\/b><\/div>\n<p><b>Tracking Initiative<\/b>: One player of the gaming group will be designated to track the initiative of the PCs and the NPCs (as determined by the GM).\n<\/p>\n<p><b>Determination of Intent:<\/b> The GM&#8217;s determination of a characters\/players intent will stand unless it was specifically spelled out by a player, so long as the GM can explain it within the context of the characters code(s) or outlook. Its not the GM&#8217;s job to second guess the players.\n<\/p>\n<p><b>End of Character Turn<\/b>: After a character has ended their turn and the next character&#8217;s (PC or NPC) has begun to resolve there is no going back and applying effects or changing outcomes.\n<\/p>\n<p><b>Track Character Supplies<\/b>: As your character uses equipment and resources, be fair and mark off what is used. Just as you do not have a endless free supply of items, neither does your character. This includes mundane supplies and special ones (magical, etc.) If the GM catches an abuse of this,  they are free to impose penalties such as automatic failures or equipment breakage.\n<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"style\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Style_of_Play\"><\/span>Style of Play<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Unless specifically overridden through an agreement or document specific to a play group, you can expect the following stylistic elements to be present in all session of game in.\n<\/p>\n<p><b>RPG Emphasis on Challenge<\/b>: While some prefer the role-playing aspect of an RPG game to be about escape, wherein they find themselves the protagonist and &#8220;heroic&#8221;, I prefer the challenge aspect of roleplaying. This means working within race, class\/archetype, location, and cultural constraints to make an interesting character or situation and playing out decisions based on perspectives and values other than my own. Ethical limits can be stretched, tests can be made, group dynamics altered and the means to success outside my own perspective explored in an interesting and safe way. By default, the action presented will be deadly and knowledge\/non-combat skills may be just as important, if not more, in dealing with situations. The impulse to simply rush in, laying waste, will more often get you killed.\n<\/p>\n<p><b>Gritty Realism<\/b>: I will use an increased level of lethality and realism whenever possible. This means situationally, the rules may not apply if the GM knowledge and\/or situation means that normal outcomes would not be facilitated. The emphasis on story too may include alteration of the rules based on the circumstances the characters are in. I try and make this reflective of real life cause and effects to the fullest extent possible.\n<\/p>\n<p><b>Rules Advocacy\/Disagreements<\/b>: Simple mistakes are one thing &#8211; &#8220;oh yea, that effects is 100, not 50 feet&#8221;, these can be corrected with a exchange of a sentence or two. Interpretation of rules, or if the GM says something does not apply, arguments and disagreements  will not be tolerated. The GM has privelaged information that affects the outcome of many things that the PCs do not have. If a player interjects that the situation is preventing them from operating within the strict rules, and the GM indicates that they are aware of it but that it does not apply, do not halt the flow of the game. After the session is the time to discuss disagreements or why the rules were inapplicable.\n<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"charcreate\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Character_Creation\"><\/span>Character Creation<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Players are responsible for creating their own characters.

The GM will disallow or may penalize obvious min\/maxing and attempts at taking minor disadvantages to get a few more perks.

The campaign GM may allow other people to GM\/run scenarios only after reviewing the concept and stipulating any restrictions to ensure balance and continuity.
