Recognized for potential early he was raised by an order of the Church of whelm, spending much of his time learning leadership skills and how to understand all peoples. For him there has never been another path, no wavering, not even a question of what his life could have been. He humbly accepted all duties and very quickly rose to favor within his order and gained grace with his god. By the Age of 16 his church sent him to lead expeditions into the darklands.<\/p>\n<p>After 8 years of war, turmoil and constant stress Hymblis was finally caught out by the dark forces, being impaled, beaten, his spine broken and much of his flesh ripped from his bones by orrish teeth, only the presence of his bretheren saved him. Refusing to let a man who had saved and healed them time and time again they lost half of their unti pulling Hymblis from enemy hands, and called directly to Whelm for divine intervention. Hymblis and his entire unit were pulled from the field within the week, and sen to the fortified pass of the Hammer and Anvil.<\/p>\n<p>Hymblis has seen little combat since then, his body permanently weakened from his horrible injuries. He has spent much of his time teaching the next generation and aiding in healing of the horribly wounded. While he can no longer wage the war he had deep in the darklands, his soul has lost patience for peace. He knows that he will soon be called to serve again, and is quietly waiting for the time that he can become the Shield of Light once more.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Hymblis Cleric Archetype Kinetic: 1 Chi: 25 Magic: Manna: Faith: 5 Synergy: 150 -40-10-5-20-10-10-5 Res: 39 Enc: Age: 45 Essence: 36\/32 (Some lost on divine intervention) -1 mad hermit RCT: 3 VIG: 4 STR: 3 (used to be 4) CHR: 6 +1 MS (Engaging Disposition) RSN: 4 SAN: 6 +1 MS (Sensible Disposition) INT: 6 [&hellip;]<\/p>\n<a role=\"link\" class=\"rtp-readmore\" title=\"Read more on Original-Hymblis\" href=../../../../22http/incarnanet/host/kelly-berger/char/character-ideas/hymblis/original-hymblis/22_38667294.html rel=\"nofollow\">Read More \u2192<\/a>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"parent":3924,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":[],"categories":[],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/3925"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3925"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/3925\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":3926,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/3925\/revisions\/3926"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/3924"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3925"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3925"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3925"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
