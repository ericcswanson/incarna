Meena takes the Alert Feat.<br \/>\nWe are facing the man who kidnapped Rax.  He looks somewhat skeleton like.  As he approaches, our lights go dim.  Lennil Tarvo is his name.<br \/>\nTarvo attacks Balder with a nice sword, hitting him.<br \/>\nMeena casts Hail of Thorns as a bonus.  Then she attacks hitting twice, including a crit, but for small damage.<br \/>\nTalia throws a dagger, hitting him.<br \/>\nModax casts Magic Missiles, and uses his metamagic spell for another attack.<br \/>\nZorachai casts his Bardic Inspiration on Balder.  Then attacks with his short bow, but misses.<br \/>\nBalder attacks with his great axe.  Tarvo uses his reaction to force a re-roll, which still hits.  He takes his \u201caction surge\u201d and rolls for another attack, but misses.<br \/>\nColor spray goes off and Zorachai goes blind.  Modax is struck by something that poisoned him.  It was Leo and Lap, two of Tarvo\u2019s workers who were also killed with Tarvo, attack us from behind.<br \/>\nTarvo attacks Balder hitting with the first and critting with the second.<br \/>\nMeena misses her attacks.<br \/>\nTalia hits with her other dagger.<br \/>\nZorachai is still blind.  Leo attacks him with a poisoned knife, but he is not affected.<br \/>\nModax casts Web at Leo and Lap to restrain them on the wall of the cave.<br \/>\nLap casts Dispel Magic and the web disappears.<br \/>\nZorachai heals Balder for 11 pts.<br \/>\nBalder attacks with his great axe.  Tarvo forces him to re-roll his hit causing him to miss.<br \/>\nTarvo hits Balder and he drops.<br \/>\nMeena misses with one, but hits with her second attack.  Tarvo is still standing.<br \/>\nTalia misses.<br \/>\nLeo attacks Talia, hitting her.<br \/>\nModax casts True Strike on himself.<br \/>\nLap hits Talia.<br \/>\nZorachai can see now.

He moves to a corner and finds Rax.  She is tired and dehydrated.  She is in a bad way and has been tortured.  Modax casts Sleep on her so she can rest.<br \/>\nOur lights come back up.  We feel poorly.  We are standing in front of a seal that seem to be radiating bad feelings.  Zorachai casts comprehend language to try to read the words on the seal.  He reads \u201chere lies Gatbok.  The rest is a warning about disturbing him.<br \/>\nWhile we are waiting for her to rest, we role the bodies.  We find leather armor on Tarvo.+1 on elemental damage. +2 to hide in shadows.  +2 against dragon fear.<br \/>\nThe long sword that looks better than normal.  +1 on damage.<br \/>\nOne of the men is wearing a headband that looks interesting.  Balder touches it and it shocks him.  We pick it up with tongs and put it in a bag.  Lawful evil, reduces magical damage by 1.<br \/>\n He has some jewelry (400 gp)<br \/>\n250 gp X 2. 2 Shorts words &#038; 2 daggers.<br \/>\nA magic ring-darkness (1 charge).<br \/>\nA pair of soft leather gauntlets of swimming and climbing.<br \/>\nPotion of Speed.<\/p>\n<p>Rax wakes up.  She has been tortured.  Torval tried to open the seal, but they were attacked by a great chieftain, a bear, and bats.  Rax survived because she did not want to open the seal.<br \/>\nWe decide to put the bear skull helm back where we got it.  As we leave this cave, we seal it back the way we found it and undisturbed.<\/p>\n<p>As we turn to leave, a great white bear appears in front.  He is pleased with our actions on the island.  He gives us his memories and wisdom to protect us.<\/p>\n<p>All of our party gets the Ranger\u2019s Favored Enemies.  Meena (since she\u2019s already a Ranger) gets Primeval Awareness on a Favored enemy without using a spell slot.<br \/>\nWe return the helm and then make our way to the boat.  We approach the boat stealthily.  Zorokai stumbles and shows himself.  A goblin on the ship reacts and shoots Zorachai.  But he is not hurt badly and he makes a joke.<br \/>\nZorokai asks for a ride to the mainland.  They ask for 100 gp.  Z counters with 50 gp.  They agree.  Zorakai also entertains them well enough that they forget the 50 gp.  They set us adrift on their only longboat close to the mainland, and we make our way to shore.  <\/p>\n<p>We are in town and the townsfolk are upset because of the death of the crew on the longboat.  Zorokai tells them our story.  At the end, they are placated and amazed by our adventure.  We rest the night in the inn.   We are served breakfast and some people follow us on our way out of town.<br \/>\nRax is exhausted and will not be joining us in our hunt for the Paritan.<br \/>\nWe head for the mountain, where we believe its nest is.  The climb is somewhat dangerous.  Modax, Zorokai, and Talia fall and hurt themselves.<br \/>\nMeena heals Talia some.  Zorokai heals himself.  We see a creature launch itself from the top of the mountain.<br \/>\nThe Peryton flies over us casting a shadow.  Meena is paralyzed (3 min or until damaged).  Modax starts babbling and is unable to speak (8 min).  Talia is stunned for 2 rounds.  It glides past and flies away.<br \/>\nBalder shoots with her crossbow, but misses.<br \/>\nZorokai shoots with a short bow, but misses.<br \/>\nModax misses.<br \/>\nThe Peryton comes back around.  It attacks Zorokai, but misses it\u2019s first, but hits with its talon.<br \/>\nBalder fires his crossbow.<br \/>\nZorokai heals himself, then casts Bardic Inspiration on Balder.<br \/>\nModax hits.<br \/>\nThe Peryton comes back around at Zorokai, but misses.<br \/>\nBalder shoots and hits her.<br \/>\nTalia wakes up long enough to throw a dagger, but misses.<br \/>\nZorokai takes it out with his shot.  It falls down into the rocks.  Modax cuts off her head.  Meena finally starts to move and Modax is now able to speak.<br \/>\nThe party ropes up and climbs to the top.  Twigs have been woven into Druidic symbols.  It seems strange to Meena. We perceive there is a struggle going on between nature and civilization.<br \/>\nWe take the head back to town.<br \/>\nMr. Foxx will give us 900 gp.  <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>World of Ph&#8217;yrin Tys!
