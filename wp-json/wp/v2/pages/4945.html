It is here were the ties to the lands of chaos are thinnest. It is thought the guardian of the land is near god-like in theor own power (within the confines of th eland itself). The guardian is an ancient creature, with an endless memory and ability to discern the gulfs of mortal thoughts. Many statues of from other of the 6 lands are brought here, to be gazed upon and contemplated by the lands great guardian; it is from the depths of these thought, locked in stone to others, that the guardian somehow gains their own life-knowledge and furthers his depth of understanding of the cosmos. Ultimately, many have sought out the creature to leech from this great wisdom, but fall trap to the perils of its minions mostly, and it is rumored that challenges of greatest sort are trapped forever in the misty cerebral corridors of its magical mind maze.<\/p>\n<p>Guardian:<br \/>\nCoatl dream protecting hope\/ It is by far the most powerful guardian. It was tasked with protecting this land, and found a mate to pass the time away with. Sadly, the hope of the guardian has been turned to ash when his mate was turned into an undead creature. In the far past, defeated enemies were eaten and forever gone, but now the guardian tortures the worst of the invaders that make it as far as his land. Statues from the other lands are brought as signposts of dread. Additionally, the guardian has consigned the souls of many demons, etc. to live on in a state beyond death. Forever feeling the pain of their killing blow, they can sense the happy memories of those around them, making them even more frustrated. They prey upon those seeking to pass nearby, entrapping them with the remnants of their own power. <\/p>\n<p>Shattered City of Agrayginia<br \/>\n(A-gray-ginia) When the Lich Lords entombed the north, they used powerful magics to instantly freeze and corrupt entire cities, causing those in them to embrace the icy bargain of undeath. At the time powerful druids and cleric were working with the guardian and managed to shift an entire square quarter mile block of the city of Agrayginia into the guardians land. In the block was the great amphitheatre of Vrenbaer, sacred to the Lords of Light, which was used to summon otherworldly music and song from the outer planes &#8211; this was to be the anchor to try and save the gathered people. The portion of the city was transported, but it too became shattered. In an attempt to stop the effect from spreading, the guardians mate rushed in to stem the tide of undead sweeping out of the evil blight. The guardian was recovering and could do little, His mate sacrificed herself to contain the effect. It stopped it from spreading, and she succumbed to the embrace of undeath. She haunts the ruins now.<br \/>\n> It is a portal now which could be exploited to bring in invaders without facing the Wall of M\u2019Drone!

She still has a greater ward pact and cannot be killed by creatures of this demiplane. The guardian asks the party if they would perform this act that he cannot do.
