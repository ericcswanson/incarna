He goes by his last name of Varkos and always operates in disguise when taking jobs. By day, he poses as a simple laborer named Varkos Grith, and is part of a set of regulars that seek work at the Dragon Hearth Inn known to favor Merkaine worshipers. He is a follower of Merkaine in real life, so this no stretch. Recently he was hired to steal a figurine from a traveling merchant.\n<\/p>\n<p>When he showed up at the exchange site to collect his fee, he was taken captive. He awoke, being carried hogtied on a pole by three red skinned lizard like creatures that spoke in a language he could not understand as they were carrying him. Emerald falls was their destination &#8211; he had used its locale as a meeting place before and knew it well. Emerald Falls is also a place of magic &#8211; which is why people avoid it! Deep into the tunnels under the cliff face the falls spill over they went with him. He had a suspicion he was to be used as some sort of sacrifice. It was difficult to discern exactly where they were, but eventually &#8211; nearly a day later by his reckoning &#8211; he was dropped at the foot of some immense magical construct &#8211; a gateway of some sorts. Bound and stripped he was hauled and pushed, prodded and goaded through the portal and felt the sensation of vertigo.\n<\/p>\n<p>All he remembers is eventually waking to the sounds of battle. All around him creatures of strange geometry swarmed the red lizard creatures. They killed many but were eventually overcome. The strange creatures took him, blindfolded and trussed to some other place. He felt days of travel &#8211; food was sparse. Eventually he was handed over to some sort of monastic sect. Strange grey skinned captors, who would let him walk in a strange field of fungus &#8211; only a strange monastery surrounding him, and a swirling tunnel of magic passing beneath its depths. Little conversation has been had for weeks &#8211; they say \u201cThe end is near, those who are coming will take you.\u201d &#8211; this is all he hears. There is no place to make a break to &#8211; it\u2019s an alien place\u2026 or world, he is not sure. He is finally told that outsiders have arrived, and their moment has come\u2026 they release him from captivity and take him to meet the outsiders.\n<\/p>\n<p>Code:<br \/>\nNever robs from those who cannot afford it<br \/>\nNever robs from Merkaine\u2019s holy ground<br \/>\nNever robs \u201cbig scores\u201d (draws too much attention)<br \/>\nBusiness is business\u2026 don\u2019t make things personal in the criminal world or business<br \/>\nKnow the laws; in the criminal underground its just another set of laws &#8211; written or not<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Human, male, 5\u201910\u201d, sandy brown hair, right handed, age:23 Background: Charlatan Favorite Scam: Convincing people that worthless junk is worth their hard earned money.
