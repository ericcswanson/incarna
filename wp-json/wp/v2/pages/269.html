Get up and act out what your character says and their mannerisms - pretend you are them and faced with the same circumstances. Don't be afraid to be funny, scared, or serious - exaggerate the situation and emotions in order to make a point. What your character plans and says can often be enough for an obvious outcome. We believe <a href=../../../../22/game/gm/advisehtml/index_1258706955.html class=\"link-gm\">GM's<\/a> should encourage <a href=../../../../22/game/play/advisehtml/index_1748569420.html class=\"link-play\">Players<\/a> to role-play (and possibly grant bonuses to checks - from a minor +1, to <a style=\"text-shadow: 1px 1px 1px #C0C0C0;\" title=\"The check gains the benefits of Advantage\"><i><b>Advantage<\/b><\/i><\/a> <i class=\"fa fa-refresh\"><\/i> (similar to <a href=../../../../22/characters/trait_945892135.html>Superior Luck<\/a> or <a href=../../../../22/characters/trait_945892135.html>Leadership<\/a>), or automatic success, rather than ONLY rely on the rules of the game to resolve encounters.

Characters should be played using their defined knowledge, mannerisms, and abilities as best they can by both GM and player. Only the GM knows all the factors governing the situation, directing players to apply adjustments, or make them for the players when assessing the resolution.<\/p>\r\n<\/div><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\nAn example of a brief encounter resolution which demonstrates the level of immersive story telling and interaction the Incarna system engenders.
