Also, its said he would give his last penny to help a brother of the company out.<br \/>\nTime in the Black Hounds: {6 years}<br \/>\n&#8211; Last rank in Black Hounds was Private\/New rank in Gallants is private<br \/>\nWhat are they known for > Pennies is known for being dependable &#8211; the man you can count on in combat to watch your back. He works best if teamed up with others&#8230; he is also known for being able to be stealthy and someone who can handle themselves in the city.<\/p>\n<p>Basics of Growing Up: [Nakrian] Worked as a merchant&#8217;s assistant in Beryl until the merchant was killed in Scrape on a mission there and he was forced to hide and flee in the city. Umbakian privateers intercepted his master Taramucci which was taking a contract and survey maps to Beryl, picking up from Gwinn via pirates in Scrape. He was taken on the docks after 2 weeks by a press gang and would have been a galley slave except he could read and write, and speak multiple languages. He served on a Scrapian pirate vessel for 2 years &#8211; learning to fight but mostly learning to protect himself and becoming a master with the shield (really the only &#8220;armor&#8221; he could afford); He bought his way off it in Poeltiz of the Merchant Cities with nothing to show but his freedom. <\/p>\n<p>Entry into the company: He came upon two drunks being beaten and robbed on the docks and helped them fend off their attackers. These were 2 of the Black Hounds (the 2 are now dead); Despite his empty hands he was given a chance to prove himself &#8211; all he asked for was a shield and club and he beat back 2 attackers at once. That gained him a place with the Black Hounds. His needs are simple and he was happy to make his way around the heartlands with a family that had saved him from dying in some back alley. <\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Hearing_the_Music_of_the_Storm\"><\/span>Hearing the Music of the Storm<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n[10\/CY 9173]\n<p>After Killing the Troll Hunters and returning to the camp on the edge of Calibans Slurry, Pennies was shown the strange statue of the tentacled horror by Tellip, along with the rest of the Gallants. That night there was a loud storm about 10 miles away, over the slurry. During the night, at the height of ths storm he dreamed he danced with the lightning, and drummed with the thunder. Strange music echoed in his ears when he woke for hours, and as it faded, his temperment did too &#8211; he felt lighter on his feet, more ready with a smile, and as if a tension had been removed.
