Always with an eye on finance and creating his own larger criminal organization. Converting this to 5e is no mean feat, but with the highly customizable options, completely doable. <\/p>\n<p>Background:  (using just the players handbook)<br \/>\nGuild Artisan (cast down\/out of the guild for dabbling in forbidden secrets &#8211; ended up in the streets)<br \/>\nProficiency: Insight, Persuasion;<br \/>\nLanguages: goblin<br \/>\nTools: poisoner&#8217;s kit<br \/>\nBusiness: Alchemist and apothecaries<\/p>\n<p>Magic Using capability<br \/>\nRivkin had a touch of magic powers &#8211; enough for him to know it when its being used and a few highly specialized pieces of magic that assisted him in his craft of tracking down and killing targets. These were all based on the tradition of the scholarly magic user of early DnD editions. His interest in magic was small and never progressed far.<br \/>\nWizard 4th (4th because he had one more second level spell than normal rules for 3rd level (we used Int bonus)<br \/>\nHD: 4,4,4,4 = 16 +4 = 20<br \/>\nArcane Tradition: Divination &#8211; This reflects the high level of long range planning and intelligence he specialized in<br \/>\nProficiency: (as multiclass) None<br \/>\nFeat: Lucky<br \/>\nCantrips: Prestidigitation, Mage Hand, Message, Minor Illusion<br \/>\n1st level spells: Sunes Scar Ward (custom), Detect Magic, Charm Person, Comprehend Languages, Feather Fall, Fog Cloud, Protection from Evil\/Good, Unseen Servant, Disguise Self<br \/>\n2nd level spells: Rope Trick, Arcane Lock, Locate Object, Detect Thoughts, Phantasmal Force<\/p>\n<p>Fighting capability<br \/>\nRivkin was a light fighter, preferring weapons that could be concelaed, or using light weapons that made the best use of 2 handed fighting using dexterity. He was the equivalent of a 7th level fighter in the 2nd edition (beginning of extra attacks) rules. His early years were based on a lot of surprise attacks, and poison use. Based on equivalent power in 5e, that translates to the use of action Surge (Rivkin was really only good for a few rounds) but not a full  on extra attack &#8211; Fighter 4th.<br \/>\nHD: 6,6,6,6 = 24 +4 = 28<br \/>\nMartial Archetype: Champion<br \/>\nProficiency: (as multiclass) Medium Armor, Shields (never uses though), Martial Weapons,<br \/>\nFighting Style: Two Weapon &#8211; Add damage bonus to off hand weapon<br \/>\nSecond Wind<br \/>\nAction Surge<br \/>\nImproved Range: 19-20 is critical<br \/>\nFeat: Dual Wielder<\/p>\n<p>Rogue capability (PRIMARY)<br \/>\nPredominantly a rogue, this would have been interspersed at various points of his career. While it hard to pinpoint exactly where all that would have been woven throughout character development. That said, it would always have been a level ahead of fighter &#8211; Rogue 6th.<br \/>\nHD: 5,5,5,5,5,5 = 30 + 6 = 36<br \/>\nRoguish Archetype: Mastermind (see Sword Coast Adventurer Guide)<br \/>\nArchetype Benefits: Disguise Kit, Forgery Kit, gaming cards, Dwarvish (speak\/literate), Human (other); ability to mimic speech patterns of any creature after 1 minute of study; Help action as a bonus action (up to 30\u2019 away)<br \/>\nProficiency: Light Armor, Simple Weapons, hand crossbow, longsword, rapier, shortsword, Thieves Tools; Saves: Dexterity and Intelligence; Skills: Stealth (expert), Deception (expert), Investigation, Perception (expert)<br \/>\nSneak Attack (3D6)<br \/>\nLanguage: Cant<br \/>\nCunning Action<br \/>\nUncanny Dodge<br \/>\nFeat: Sharp Shooter<\/p>\n<p>Race: Half Elf<br \/>\nProficiency: Common, Elvish, Human (dead language); Acrobatics, History (expert)<\/p>\n<p>PROFICIENCY BONUS: +5<br \/>\nLores (+2): Finance, Cormyr, Drow, Giants<\/p>\n<p>Demon Training:<br \/>\nTaught some spells and special knowledge &#8211; consider it a level of Wizard class<br \/>\nWhip &#8211; advantage on initiative if only wielding a whip, benefits of Dueling style wielding a whip, Extra attack; distracting strike + goading attack 1\/short rest (d10\/5)<\/p>\n<p>Strength: He had no bonus, but a strength of 13 gives in in 5e.<br \/>\nSTR = 11<br \/>\nIntelligence: He was quite smart, having a 16.<br \/>\nINT = 16<br \/>\nWisdom: Not so wise, but wisdom treated slightly differently in 5e.<br \/>\nWIS = 13<br \/>\nDexterity: Maximum ability.<br \/>\nDEX = 20<br \/>\nConstitution: He got a bonus with a 15 previously, but its a different scale in 5e.<br \/>\nCON = 13<br \/>\nCharisma: Indeed he had a good charisma, but not great. Intelligence was the primary mover over pure charisma.<br \/>\nCHA = 14<br \/>\nSanity: We never played with sanity, but Rivkin definitely had several brushes with the edges of it and had trouble seeing the world the way others did. I would asses it as a slight penalty.<br \/>\nSAN = 9<\/p>\n<p>Hit Points: Essentially its 28, 20 and 36. This is more than the previous character, so i dropped the original 13 CON to 11. That gives 84-14=70. Close to the old character. However, given the elevated damage output of 5e, the original 84 seems ok. <\/p>\n<p>Typical Items<br \/>\nPoisons and Potions<br \/>\nDust of Sneezing and choking x2, Potion of Animal Friendship, Potion of Gaseous Form, Potion of Water Breathing<\/p>\n<p>Weapons<br \/>\n2 braces of three throwing knives.<br \/>\n3 x normal w\/poison<br \/>\n3 x mithril w\/poison +2<\/p>\n<p>Rapier (in 5e finesse &#8211; longsword in past)<br \/>\n+2, Sentinel power while wielded (advantage on wisdom\/perception and initiative rolls)<br \/>\nSentient: uses emotion to communicate; 30 feet senses range<br \/>\nAlignment: Lawful Neutral<\/p>\n<p>Dagger x2<br \/>\nUsed with finesse<br \/>\n+2 dagger &#8211; tarnished, detects as non magical; poison<\/p>\n<p>Short Bow<br \/>\n12 arrows<\/p>\n<p>Whip<br \/>\n+2 (counts as +4 vs who can hit); D6 force damage<br \/>\nPowers of Rope of Entanglement (90\u2019, entangles up to 3 creatures, DC 17, HP = 50)<br \/>\nSentient: hearing\/vision to 90\u2019, transmits emotions,<br \/>\nAlignment: Lawful Evil (if wielder is as well, Vicious weapon &#8211; a critical does +7 damage)<br \/>\nPurpose: aligned<br \/>\nCreator: Aberration (appears to move out of the corner of the eye)<br \/>\nHistory: Sinister<br \/>\nProperty: Wicked<br \/>\nQuirk: Confident<\/p>\n<p>Armor: Studded Leather (glamoured); +1<\/p>\n<p>Lesser Shadow Cloak<br \/>\n(rebuilt from remains\/tendrils of blown up artifact)<br \/>\n+1 Protection<br \/>\nAdvantage on Stealth (hide in shadows) checks<br \/>\nSee in absolute darkness &#8211; magical or normal 120\u2019<br \/>\nCast darkness 1\/day (double strength)<br \/>\n+2 passive perception vs. hide in shadows\/stealth<br \/>\nVanish in shadows\/darkness 1\/short rest (becomes invisible until moving or attacking)<\/p>\n<p>Gray Bag of Tricks<br \/>\nRing of Jumping<br \/>\nAmulet of Proof Against Detection and Location<\/p>\n<p>Other items and stuff in various lairs<br \/>\n2 simulacrums<br \/>\nhttps:\/\/roll20.net\/compendium\/dnd5e\/Simulacrum#content<br \/>\nThe second one violates the prohibition on having more than one, but was cast by a dragon with special knowledge.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Rivkin was a custom class from 2e, skills and powers + DMG rules.
