They are rumored to once have been dwellers in the east in the far past, before it fell, as they bear some physical resemblance to the Ilbarsi (who they openly trade with despite that people&#8217;s hostility to outsiders as well) Hill People in the Tolkisson range (though Elon eyes are almost all green, not blue like the Ilbarsi).<br \/>\nWhatever their origins, the Elon, who are now known as &#8216;travelers&#8217; or &#8216;gypsy&#8217;, once occupied an area in the eastern edges of Umbak on the edges of rivers and forests, and the hills of SE Dunstrand Vale. Once they were nominal allies of the Sea Kings and their copper (a color sacred to Elancil) colored hair was considered the height of beauty in the imperial Yvaldeysian culture. They were said to have been fishermen and worshipers of Elancil, but they were displaced by settlement, war, and disaster. They resisted, though they were finally forced by the will of all &#8216;lords&#8217; to move in order to satisfy the martial ambitions of the Teilhard&#8217;s of Umbak, then other lords who demanded land carved frm the fallen empire. Since then, they have sworn never to settle. Their culture has been preserved, at least their identity as a single people. They are typically hostile to outsiders, as the anger at being forced out of their homelands now projects to any outsider. This makes them unwelcome in most places, as many demonstrate little regard for the welfare of property of non-Elon. Though their plays and music ARE welcome, and through thee their culture and provide a mystique for the rest of the world. Though the hostility to outsiders is the common perception, most simply try and make their way amidst a world now hostile to them. They are said to be followers of the goddess Elancil, though their culture typically frowns upon open practices of faith. Their accent is thick and they commonly have green hued eyes and coppery colored hair. They tend to stick within their own culture for marriage. They follow a loose code of conduct where their own people are concerned.\n<\/p>\n<p>Elon Code (required of all characters):\n<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Always help one of the family when asked as a brother or sister in need<\/li>\n<li>Always shelter one of your own against pursuing authorities<\/li>\n<li>Take the side of the family first in all things until proven otherwise<\/li>\n<li>Business is business \u2013 keep it separate from personal matters<\/li>\n<li>Never grow too attached to items \u2013 such things come and go; family is most important<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><b>Dirty Fighters<\/b>: They have no compunctions about using deceptive and dirty tactics. Victory is not something noble, it is just necessary. They have a strong self preservation streak that means they typically learn to use improvised items and tactics which may be seen as &#8220;dirty&#8221;. There is definitely no limit to which they would not drop to in order to ensure the survival of clan and family.\n<\/p>\n<div id=\"popmapsrlm\" class=\"hidden\"><a href=../../../../22/wp-content/uploads/srlm-map-handgif/index_1662929950.html><img src=../../../../22/wp-content/uploads/srlm-map-handgif/index_1662929950.html alt=\"Steel Realms Map\" lazyload \/><\/a><\/div><div class=\"modal fade\" id=\"basicModal\" tabindex=\"-1\" role=\"dialog\" aria-labelledby=\"basicModal\" aria-hidden=\"true\">\r\n    <div class=\"modal-dialog\">\r\n        <div class=\"modal-content\">\r\n            <div class=\"modal-header\">\r\n            <button type=\"button\" class=\"close\" data-dismiss=\"modal\" aria-hidden=\"true\">X<\/button>\r\n            <h4 class=\"modal-title\" id=\"myModalLabel\">Modal title<\/h4>\r\n            <\/div>\r\n            <div class=\"modal-body\" id=\"myModalPop\">\r\n            <\/div>\r\n    <\/div>\r\n  <\/div>\r\n<\/div><script>jQuery(\"a[class^='dndclass-cleric'],a[class*=' dndclass-cleric']\").prop(\"href\",\"\/characters\/class\/cleric\");jQuery(\"a[class^='dndclass-fighter'],a[class*=' dndclass-fighter']\").prop(\"href\",\"\/characters\/class\/fighter\");jQuery(\"a[class^='dndclass-ranger'],a[class*=' dndclass-ranger']\").prop(\"href\",\"\/characters\/class\/ranger\");jQuery(\"a[class^='dndclass-barbarian'],a[class*=' dndclass-barbarian']\").prop(\"href\",\"\/characters\/class\/barbarian\");jQuery(\"a[class^='dndclass-druid'],a[class*=' dndclass-druid']\").prop(\"href\",\"\/characters\/class\/druid\");<\/script>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The is the defacto starting point for characters and races of the Steel Realms.
