The raiders of yore have vanished and the druids have watched the deadlands, making sure the evil that is said to dwell there is dormant. The farmlands near the deadlands are blessed with an abundance. But now, farmers and workers that live near these borders swear that the hills are growing &#8211; that the shadows they cast are lengthening. Fell creatures have been seen in the shadows and hillmen, fallen humans given over to darkness, once the bedtime story of wicked children are now seen in the hills, gathering about bonfires. Random patrols in force are no longer enough to keep the peace should something happen &#8211; and all signs point to an ominous force stirring in the dark hills. I fear that some nightmare is about to be unleashed under the cover  of the cool shadows of the dark hills. You must go and discover the source of our trouble, report back if you cannot stop it. You will be rewarded handsomely.&#8221;<br \/>\nReward: 1000 sc, 500 sc in jewelry, cavalry horse for each person&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>He does not say: Several patrols and farmsteads have lost people over the last 3 months.<br \/>\nThis has actually been going on for 8 years &#8211; no one has done anything about it.

The shadows cast by the dark hills are out of reach &#8211; a no mans land. We don&#8217;t plant there and whatever is in there do not come any further than the edge. The edge been getting further in shorter time! Whatever is in there wont come far, full darkness it loves not either. Now though, the hills get taller and the shadows are getting close to homes and livestock &#8211; some have even disappeared. Bad things move in the shadows each night they get closer &#8211; the rangers know it, but when they go see, they never return. Sands are blowing at night, and fires are being made &#8211; we can smell the ashes and see the sparks &#8211; though they be miles away.

They never venture far from the masters they serve &#8211; there are too few to risk them. Their leader Bakhu Tut. Their flesh is burnt from birth and hardened scar tissue develops.
