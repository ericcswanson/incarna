The church of Aerna sponsored breeding programs for dogs with dispositions that could watch over children. They were the size of [modern] Great Danes, and lived 20 years on average (the same dog would guard multiple generations of family) &#8211; It took a hundred years to breed the original species. The dogs were said to know Umbakaisn by name, scent and looks &#8211; and could prioritize protecting charges by Umbakian blood. They could find their way home from 30 miles in any direction no matter how recent a move. Gradually, competing and more warlike breeds usurped the place of the hearth hounds. Private breeders, nominally associated with Ikribu and Whelm, took over the breeding and moved from gentle disposition to one of aggressive and hostile. The possession of the dogs fell out of favor and few breeders exist. If any do, they are for private families. <\/div>\n<div id=\"know-uncommon\" class=\"tab-pane fade\">The aggressive nature of the second generation fit more with Umbak\u2019s expansionist dreams. With the bloodlines of Umbak mixing and diluting over time, the dogs got to be bonded to specific individuals instead of lineage, or just bred for the purpose of attack or defense on command. <\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>CY 6000; Last of the original Hearth Hounds (recognized <a href=../../../../22http/incarnanet/verse/set/steel-realms/divine/light/houthas/22_826040362.html title=\"\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"\" class=\"\">The Houthas<\/a>).<\/li>\n<li>CY 7200; Hearth Hounds &#8220;2nd generation&#8221; (trained to identify and protect against the Nurth) ends.<\/li>\n<li>CY 7500; The smithys of Ikribu and Balthazaar collaborated on making a light scale armor for the dogs.<\/li>\n<li>CY 7900; Hearth Hounds &#8220;3rd generation&#8221; (trained for defence and sentry) ends.
