They have intercepted some of the equipment that seekers of wisdom have shed in the village that the monks usually end up with, gathered it to defend themselves should the need come.<br \/>\nDark Past: In the early days, more than 500 years ago, the men ruled and held the women as slaves. There were 3 women to every 1 man, and they were treated horribly. Male babies were generally killed unless a loss was to be replaced. The women rose up and murdered the men, throwing the few young men and a couple of the older in chains to use as breeding stock.<br \/>\nThey hate outsiders and are well guarded by the council of 5<br \/>\n#1 Maria<br \/>\nEquip: Short bow<br \/>\n@2 Eunice<br \/>\nEquip: Short bow<br \/>\n#3 Belda (priestess of Whelm; Cleric level 5 [War])<br \/>\n#4 Carrie (priestess of Ezrilus; senior, Cleric level 7 [Nature])<br \/>\nCommands rat horde during day as watchers<br \/>\nCommands bat horde at night as watchers<br \/>\n#5 Freida<br \/>\nEquip: Short bow<br \/>\nOlder Women: 8<br \/>\nAnemic male slaves: 6<br \/>\nAdolescent Women: 7<br \/>\n1 acolyte for each priestess (as cleric level 1)<\/p>\n<p>Possible Quest: The PC\u2019s will be helping to clean and tend fields, in preparation for the monastery closing and the monks fleeing.

They will try and access it and get revenge on the women &#8211; rape and murder. If the initial attempts fail, then a [fated] check with disadvantage for turning aside the mob (Intimidate or Deception could work too &#8211; but always with disadvantage). Angry Man-Mob: HP: 20, 20, 20, 20, 30, and 40 (leader: Michael), weakened from slavery so no fighter abilities except leader as F5 (champion). Weapons cache is 10 daggers, 5 spears, a battle axe, and 2 long sword &#8211; spears can be thrown. They will threaten but tactics will be to swarm who they believe to be the leader and overwhelm them. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Valley\u2019s Dark Secret There is a hidden place where a few adventurers have fled to.
