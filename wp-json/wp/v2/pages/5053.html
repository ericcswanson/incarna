Her people were traveling through Ser-Caynth in the northern Merchant Cities and had run a dangerous scam on a wizard of Haethgren&#8217;s Reach. Her parents were afflicted with a magical disease, which killed them and several others of the clan. So sick was she, that she was wrapped in a burial shroud at one point and rose from her fevered dreams during the Wake when she heard her sister&#8217;s voice &#8211; she had contracted the same evil in her throat and tongue. They were moving east, and passed by Salt Marsh. Sick to the point of death, she went to the Narcosa Guild &#8211; well known practitioners of Necromancy. She volunteered her death in exchange for the knowledge to save her sister. Instead the guild took her in. Touched by death, and fueled by a desire for life, she was at the very least an oddity. A few cryptic questions and test later and the guild offered her her life of service in exchange for her sisters life. She agreed and her sister was saved. She quickly learned that the &#8216;dark arts&#8217; were not as dark as she once thought. The guild were seekers into the &#8220;mysteries of the body&#8221; &#8211; health, disease, medicine, herbalism&#8230; all these things she learned before tapping her aptitude for magic. She  assisted midwives, apothecaries, surgeons and soon became inured to the worst life had to offer. Then on to assisting the limited priesthood of the fallen death god, working in potters field to bury, treating the dying in the streets, and finally exploring the arts of torture of the body &#8211; the limits of pain and suffering in the psyche.<\/p>\n<p>The guild poured resources into training her, including educating her in the perceptions of the Necromancer,and how best to tap into that without pushing limits. The way she dressed, held herself, and language she used. She was tutored for a long time in the specialist ways of her guild. Her connection to the Elon was broken a hundred times, and now she cares little for nation, people, or race &#8211; except as a means of advancing the knowledge of her and her brethren. To fight disease, poverty, and the worst of the human condition are core tenants of many in her guild &#8211; and she believes in them. She is tied somehow to the death god and to death &#8211; the guild masters made her understand this, but even they could not fathom the exact nature of it. Her death was celebrated, and she returned &#8211; this grants her a special place in her guild.<\/p>\n<p>Still, beneath it all, she never let go of the burning need for revenge. She harbors this deep under everything and vows to one day confront the mage that slew her parents. <\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"A_Problem_with_the_Living\"><\/span>A Problem with the Living<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><a href=../../../../22/host/larry-james/chars/gabrella/22_1309548065.html>Gabrella<\/a>, <a href=../../../../22/host/marc-chapman/chars/emily/22_192049779.html>Emily<\/a>, <a href=../../../../22/edward-berg/chars/dairn/22_223760430.html>Dairn<\/a>, <a href=../../../../22/host/kelly-royal/chars/justav/22_1132362303.html>Justav<\/a>, <a href=../../../../22/host/tara-flannery/chars/toulath-silverhair/22_875904257.html>Toulath<\/a>, and <a href=../../../../22/host/steven-grenier/chars/gaardu/22_102517828.html>Gaardu<\/a> have joined forces to track down and evil renegade of the Narcosa Necromancer Guild and stop hm before he can do something horrible. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<a role=\"link\" class=\"rtp-readmore\" title=\"Read more on Gabrella (character)\" href=../../../../22http/incarnanet/host/larry-james/chars/gabrella/22_404492877.html rel=\"nofollow\">Read More \u2192<\/a>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"parent":371,"menu_order":59,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":[],"categories":[],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/5053"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=5053"}],"version-history":[{"count":11,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/5053\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":7477,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/5053\/revisions\/7477"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/371"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=5053"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=5053"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=5053"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
