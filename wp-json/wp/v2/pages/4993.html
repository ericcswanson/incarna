The guild also has a special relationship with the fallen death god Djerduth. The guild promotes the old gods ways, carrying on the religious traditions of death as a natural part of life, and seeking its mysteries to better understand the living. Far from the &#8220;death-worshiping anemic&#8221; its enemies portray it as, its members are the most physically fit and robust of wizardly orders &#8211; they practice medicine and are adherents of physical exercise and know the body and its workings like few others. The order serves as healers even in some places, such as North Gate Garrison They are THE premier operators against the undead there and other places in the north.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=../../../../22/verse/set/steel-realms/occult/22_254961711.html>Presence Levels<\/a>: Preeminent in northern heartlands; Order houses all over the north&#8230;\n<ul>\n<li>Major: Salt Marsh<\/li>\n<li>Minor: North Gate Garrison, Lim, Arminsted<\/li>\n<li>Trivial: Twin Springs, Karolak, Soriano, Thurlow<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=../../../../22/verse/set/steel-realms/occult_2065123163.html>Alliances<\/a>: None\n<li><a href=../../../../22/verse/set/steel-realms/occult/22_254961711.html>Occult Focus<\/a>: Schools of Magical Study&#8230;\n<ul>\n<li>Major: Necromancy<\/li>\n<li>Minor: <\/li>\n<li>Trivial: <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=../../../../22/verse/set/steel-realms/occult_2065123163.html>Familiar Specialty<\/a>: Lesser Homonculous<br \/>\nFetus like flesh creation; AC 12, HD: 1\/HP = 4 [Cost = 180 silvers]\nDexterity\/Wisdom 15, Strength (half creators current; 5), Charisma 3, All Others 10<br \/>\nNever sleeps, never tires, cannot be charmed or slept; sees through illusions.

It is believed some necromantic experiment from the Houses of the Dead in Ados got loose, and the masters there care little for those outside the city. There was a great deal of animosity towards them and the city, and supplies began to run low in the city of certain items, as merchants and travelers stayed away. The Narcosa Guild sent in members to try and figure out how to keep it contained, along with the White Sisters. It was only after a Darkling plot was revealed as its source that the region\u2019s civil unrest was averted. Orban was one of the two senior members of that delegation from Narcosa, and the one who finally slew the Darkling after tracing it to Corrigans Inn (at a major crossroads) &#8211; where it had poisoned\/cursed the well and that was spreading the disease. <\/div>\n<div id=\"item-know1\" class=\"tab-pane fade panel\"><i class=\"know-more-still\">Typically a DC 15 or higher Check<\/i><\/div>\n<div id=\"item-know2\" class=\"tab-pane fade panel\"><i class=\"know-more-still\">Typically a DC 20 or higher Check<\/i><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"popmapsrlm\" class=\"hidden\"><a href=../../../../22/wp-content/uploads/srlm-map-handgif/index_1662929950.html><img src=../../../../22/wp-content/uploads/srlm-map-handgif/index_1662929950.html alt=\"Steel Realms Map\" lazyload \/><\/a><\/div><div class=\"modal fade\" id=\"basicModal\" tabindex=\"-1\" role=\"dialog\" aria-labelledby=\"basicModal\" aria-hidden=\"true\">\r\n    <div class=\"modal-dialog\">\r\n        <div class=\"modal-content\">\r\n            <div class=\"modal-header\">\r\n            <button type=\"button\" class=\"close\" data-dismiss=\"modal\" aria-hidden=\"true\">X<\/button>\r\n            <h4 class=\"modal-title\" id=\"myModalLabel\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Modal_title\"><\/span>Modal title<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\r\n            <\/div>\r\n            <div class=\"modal-body\" id=\"myModalPop\">\r\n            <\/div>\r\n    <\/div>\r\n  <\/div>\r\n<\/div><script>jQuery(\"a[class^='dndclass-cleric'],a[class*=' dndclass-cleric']\").prop(\"href\",\"\/characters\/class\/cleric\");jQuery(\"a[class^='dndclass-fighter'],a[class*=' dndclass-fighter']\").prop(\"href\",\"\/characters\/class\/fighter\");jQuery(\"a[class^='dndclass-ranger'],a[class*=' dndclass-ranger']\").prop(\"href\",\"\/characters\/class\/ranger\");jQuery(\"a[class^='dndclass-barbarian'],a[class*=' dndclass-barbarian']\").prop(\"href\",\"\/characters\/class\/barbarian\");jQuery(\"a[class^='dndclass-druid'],a[class*=' dndclass-druid']\").prop(\"href\",\"\/characters\/class\/druid\");<\/script>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Narcosa Guild is one of the only 2 major institutions to focus on Necromancy in the realms.
