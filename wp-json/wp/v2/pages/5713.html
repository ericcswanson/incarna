She goes by the last name \u201cTeclaud\u201d \u2013 given to her by her mother. Living in exile, and under the auspices of incest and rape, her father Berithor refused to have anything to do with her, and saw to it that she was not educated or treated in any way special; even to the extent of forbidding her doctors when she was sick.
