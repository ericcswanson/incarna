The goddess Elancil decides to cast a dream web about the party as a warning to them not to meddle. She seeks to protect her agents and schemes by bringing misfortune to the party. <\/div>\n<div><b>Who<\/b>: The goddess Elancil.<\/div>\n<div><b>What<\/b>: Because the party is beginning to upset the balance of power on the barony of Crestwold, the goddess casts them into a dream realm where they cannot die, but can indeed suffer. The characters have to fight for their lives and plot a way off the island. <\/div>\n<div><b>Where<\/b>: A dream realm island located in the Aether.<\/div\n\n\n<div><b>When<\/b>: No time elapses for the party, the start and end tracks through a night of sleep and meditation.<\/div>\n<div><b>Prerequisites<\/b>: The character must have completed the Sacking of Hotherwale adventure in the Transformation of Crestwold campaign. <\/div>\n<h4 id=\"know-char\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"What_the_Characters_Know\"><\/span>What the Characters Know<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n<p>The characters have no idea or clue about the nature of the adventure to start with.<\/p>\n<h4 id=\"fit-into-existing\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Fitting_into_Existing_Campaign\"><\/span>Fitting into Existing Campaign<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n<p>It is intended to be part of the Transformation of Crestwold campaign.

Where SALT is noted as the source of damage, it does either Acid or Necrotic, whichever is more effective. It is a watery liquid that has a slight salty smell and flavor, and has crystalline fragments &#8211; like salt &#8211; in it. Where it is noted to do splash damage, fire damage negates and piercing damage prevents splash effects.\n<\/p>\n<p><b>Character Death<\/b>: Characters cannot actually die in this dream quest. If a character dies, the PC group gains one Token of Misfortune for Elancil in the Crestwold campaign. Any death result, or drop below 1 HP indicates the character experiences the wrath of Elancil in its full fury, scarring them mentally in addition to granting the group misfortune. For each death, they suffer a cumulative -1 on Sanity and Constitution checks while caught in the dream quest. <mark>Total Party Kill<\/mark> > This counts as double the misfortune tokens.

Thunder shakes the ground and you collapse. A shock wave twists your body and lights fill your eyes. Your back cracks, your neck twists like a giant has corkscrewed your body and pain lances through every nerve, overwhelming you into unconsciousness. A terrifying woman\u2019s voice screams in your ear, \u201cTouch not, lest ye be touched!\u201d You scream in agony as breaths fills your lungs again. Your wounds slowly transform, bleeding subsiding, ripped and sundered flesh tearing, toxins purging. In a few moments, your scream tapers off and death becomes just a memory. <\/div>\n<p>Characters return to play where they died after 3 rounds of intense healing and returning to 50% of their health.

For days you have dreamt of crashing waves and stormy seas. A woman&#8217;s voice, distant on the winds, can barely be heard crying a warning not to come closer. It seems nothing more than a scene from a play you once caught out of the corner of your eye. Finally one night, you fall into a deep trance like state, surrounded by a wet sea-fog. You wake up swaying, in a hammock, in pitch dark, with mist all around you. Its covering your skin in cool wetness, almost caressing it. <\/div>\n<p>If any character is damaged, DC 10 Constitution save or D4\/2 more SALT damage from the mist. The PCs are in full battle kit, with a single primary weapon and smaller backup weapon if normal. They may have a field kit (medical, satchel with spell book, etc.) if they normally have one, but no adventurers day packs or the like.

In the hold, if it is dark or the character cannot see in absolute darkness, they suffer D6\/3 damage as they go tumbling about. Getting out of the hold requires either 3 rounds of DC 15 Dexterity checks to move and find a way out (each failure means the character is thrown for D6\/3 damage). Characters may hold on indefinitely until the ship finally breaks up (5 rounds) using a DC 10 Strength check and gripping whatever can be found.

The wind is howling, like a screaming banshee, the waves are crashing, and the water covering the ship is freezing cold. You struggle to control the sails and rudder, to keep the boat from going broadside into the storm and ripping apart. This goes on for a seemingly endless amount of time.<\/div>\n<p>The PCs have 3 rounds to get control of the rudder and main sail as per [Controlling the Ship] encounter. At the end of the three rounds, they must have secured both, or the boat capsizes as described in that encounter. If the PCs get control, they must make enough continuing Rudder Control and Sail Control checks to get them near the island.\n<\/p>\n<p><b>Rudder Control<\/b>: DC 12 Strength check; 2 characters can contribute to 10 checks or 5 checks each.

The ship is moving far faster than it has a right to, powered by waves and wind behind it. The timbers groan and creak endlessly. The sun sets and the sky is dark, though the gale rages on. A huge, bright moon rises in the sky, seemingly so close you could touch it. You have no idea how long you have been fighting this battle, but the fatigue is beyond anything you can imagine. A wall of mist looms ahead and the prow splits it and a warm wave of air hits you. An island hoves into view through the storm. <\/div>\n<p>Character should all make a DC 10 Constitution check.

In the end, the ship strikes a rock near the island as they are maneuvering it and the PCs can easily get to shore. A warm wind blows and the characters are healed in full. They flounder in the surf undertow, but persevere.\n<\/p>\n<p>Failure > If they fail either of them, the mast snaps and the ship keels over while the gale is tossing them about and sucked into the undertow. In such circumstances the PCs must make three DC 9 Athletics check to swim to shore; each failure is 1 damage x char level damage.

It is not the world they are used to &#8211; this is evident because nothing is where it is supposed to be.\n<\/p>\n<p>Resting: The party can get a rest in any time. The mist may be cool, but the breeze is warm. It is a tropical island. After 16 hours of knowing the party has come ashore, the cloud giant Vitorienese will come seeking with the pair of dire wolves, hunting the PCs.

You are on a sandy beach. To one side is a rocky cliff going straight up, with weird deep channels cut into the cliff face going up into scrub and mist. To the other side the beach stretches out what must be a half mile before curving out of sight. All around the island is a ring of drifting mist. The island you seem to be on is sheathed in a cold mist that comes off the sea, meeting a fog that seems to hide a peak on the island. The trees are nearly impenetrable after 10 feet in the treeline. There are many small streams and terrain lines covering the island &#8211; the way to the top would be difficult. <\/div>\n<p>Noise: In a weird effect, the channels funnel sound up to the destroyed temple and cloud giant.

You find enough materials at hand to create a small shelter and take stock of your surroundings. The tropical forest is inhabited by strange insects (you can hear their unmistakable buzz), small animals and the island surrounded by ample fish in the sea. There is enough game to live on. A few small streams spill out into the sea along the beach, indicating a supply of fresh water. By the suns unfamiliar position in the sky, you estimate that it is only a few hours after sunrise. <\/div>\n<ol>\n<li>Defeat the cloud giant<\/li>\n<li><a href=../../../../22_842147072.html>Build a boat and escape<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Mass suicide<\/li>\n<li><a href=../../../../22_842147072.html>Learn to survive and do not return<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2 id=\"build-boat\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Building_a_Boat\"><\/span>Building a  Boat<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>There is plenty of wood, if the group has the skills to build a boat and sail off.

A grey curtain of rain dumps on the sea between you and it. As it is the only landmark in the area, you strike out for it. The wind is picking up slightly in your favor.
