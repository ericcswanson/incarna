En route to the Druids of the Lonely Road, she vanished. It was the first woman to win the contest in 30 years. They are to not to reveal their status as a ranger &#8211; instead to hide their identity, find a group of local, blend in, and research what information can be found\u2026 When he reached Correl, the capital of the vale, he began to research what was about. There were few of the \u201cadventuring\u201d sort, but enough to perhaps put together a group. He would have to put the group together and start on goals not directly related to his task &#8211; to see if he could trust them and eventually turn them to his long term goal of finding out what happened. Winnifred Gilmont &#8211; the winner of last years Test of Seven. In Correl, the capital of the vale, the name he heard the most was MayBug. MayBug was a strange elven mage of sorts. Many rumors were connected to him. Seeker of treasure, delver of ruins, fixer, finder of lost items and people. One thing stood out and that\u2019s his reputation for never breaking his word. This is exactly the kind of person he needed. But, he needed a hook to get MayBug on his side. He hatched a plan to add some grandiose notions to his relationship with the group he would build. And surely if he could get MayBug, MayBug would find the rest. He kept his ear open for the opportunity he needed. Soon he began to hear of an outcast druid operating on the north of the vale, along the Lonely Road. He sought out this person, they were easy to find and almost seemed to find him (such is the ways of the druid) before he found them. On the road, by himself, he felt he was bait, but it worked. \u201cLucky it was I that found you, and not the Orrish raiders or bandits\u201d said the druid. Indeed he played it as if it was pure chance, but the quickness of it all left him unsettled. He gave the druid a story about how it was the goddess of the moon &#8211; Ezrilus &#8211; that had appeared to him in a vision. He was seeking his fortune and fame, come from far to the east and was searching deep in the heart of the forest. She had led him along the path for hundreds of miles to this very spot, and the night before shown him a vision of the moon over a tower. When he described the tower in detail, the druid claimed that it was the tower of of the Viscount in Correl. He believed then that that is where they were meant to go &#8211; that somehow their destinies were tied together. The druid seemed to need to hear this, and he laid his story of lost love at the ranger\u2019s feet. Together they traveled to Correl. The ranger also told him of something he kept seeing in his dreams, and proceeded to describe the crest worn by the adventurer MayBug. Even the druid had heard of MayBug &#8211; he had been a fixture in these parts for nearly a decade.  By all reckoning and if the rumors were true, the druid said that would be a good person to have on their side &#8211; but he was typically merely a \u2018for-hire\u2019 sort. The ranger convinced him to pitch the idea of forming a group, equals, and see what MayBug said. They arranged a meeting and MayBug did not disappoint. Dressed in garish colors and regalia, he was anything but intimidating. Sort of a bookish type, but given the rumors\u2026 it had to be merely a ruse. MayBug agreed, but seemed hesitant. MayBug said if he could gather his pick, and if they would join, then he too would join. It would take a couple weeks to put all his affairs in order, and work on recruiting his \u2018victims\u2019 as he called them. They all agreed to meet back at the Three Jacks Inn in Correl on the appointed date at noon. There was just enough coin to get them through a few more weeks. After 10 days came word from MayBug that the first recruit was in &#8211; a local rake named Reynald; an \u2018independent\u2019 thief (to not mince words). After 2 more days word of the final recruit &#8211; a man named Chaz; a somewhat famous member of the north watch in Correl. A day before the appointed meeting, the ranger confessed to the druid that his father was one of the High King\u2019s Rangers (a lie, but near truth to serve his mission), and that he had been taught many of the ways of the rangers (this would explain his powers). Exactly as he had planned, the druid felt at long last, this might be his calling; even if he was not a true ranger, perhaps, under a druid\u2019s guidance, he could become one\u2026 all feels like it&#8217;s falling into place. <\/p>\n<p>>> <a href=../../../../22/verse/set/steel-realms/campaign/records/meargensdale-politics/22_170681705.html>Meargensdale Politics<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>History Ranger is sent to the area from the Rangers of the Red March (east of Rhyl) to seek more information on the death of last years winner of the Test of Seven (the local festival\/test that those seeking entrance into the High Kings Rangers make each year, locally).
