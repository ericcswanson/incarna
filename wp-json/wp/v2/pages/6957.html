The Winter People were mountain valley folk, with auburn hair, pale skin and living at great heights among the blustery cold winds. They worshiped a strange elemental power named &#8220;Achrae&#8221;, also called &#8220;The Lonely Voice&#8221; &#8211; Achrae roamed the remote peaks searching for a counterpoint to his whistling voice. They had a tradition of powerful magic and song, though there were few of them. Icrane was brought up strong on his family traditions, and became a sorcerer like his grandfather and mother before him. He took on song and dance, to take his mother\u2019s place and lead the people of his village in their ceremonies.<\/p>\n<p>He learned the powerful voice he had by singing from the high mountain tops to echo for as long as he could. He followed the hunters of his clan and sang them the song of war to bolster their courage and used the wind he summoned to amplify his voice. He withstood the trials of ice, wind, and lightning with his mother in order to wrestle the powers of the elements.<\/p>\n<p>Following his people\u2019s traditions, he left them for a year and went north, following the peaks into Ghunfar to have his far-ranging time as all of the singers must, and return with knowledge of the outside world and tell stories of it. For months he watched the edges of civilized society, learning their ways and the dialect of his people&#8217;s language.<\/p>\n<p>In Ghunfar he struggled, but soon fell in with a band of violent sell-swords called the Death\u2019s Cradle. He was saved by them, nearly killed by a runaway cart in one of the cities when Elid the Stoney stepped in and saved him. In Icrane\u2019s culture, his life was then bonded to Elid. Forced into depravity and violence, he served a full three years in the debt to Elid before he repaid it.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Civil_War_of_Meritan\"><\/span>Civil War of Meritan<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>The mercenaries were hired by the council of Meritan. Suspicions grew over time, of council members acting inappropriately. Two factions of the city of Meritan plunged it into civil war. The faction of Sir Hugh Duvre lead a people\u2019s army against the governor and council which had overtaxed the populace and left little to defend them from the marauders of the steppe that were preying on the caravans and fields. The civil war lasted over 4 months and at least 10,000 were killed. At first, the civil war was a war of factions in the streets. Then the council got desperate and enjoined the smugglers and thieves of the city &#8211; and even a few shady mercenary bands on the sly. Soon, civilians were turning on each other and the city burned. Trade crashed, fortunes fell, and the population fled. Sir Hugh turned to desperate tactics himself lives of innocents were snuffed out in reprisal. Sir Hugh Duvre was captured and hung and quartered for his crimes. The people were brutally suppressed just before a force of the king\u2019s arrived to take matters into his hands. Some of the council were jailed; the mercenaries escaped just ahead of the trials.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Assault_on_Twin_Rocks\"><\/span>Assault on Twin Rocks<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Death\u2019s Cradle were hired to spearhead an attack against encroaching nomads of the stripped Steppe &#8211; though they were merely defending themselves against the loss of river valley land taken from them in conquest. An attack was launched on their sacred place, called Twin Rocks. It was there, in the ensuing chaos, that Icrane managed to save one of the brotherhoods own and repay the debt. Despite this, he did all he could to save as many of the steppe folk in secret. He betrayed his bonds &#8211; binds he never believed in other than keeping his oath to repay those that saved him.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Time_with_the_Steppe_Folk\"><\/span>Time with the Steppe Folk<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>He spent a year among the Silver Hair clan of the steppe folk &#8211; trying to erase the debt for attacking their people. The shaman of the people understood he was also a sacred one, a wind-talker like some of their healers. He studied with them and learned more esoteric arts, building on his own wrathful powers with a softer perspective.<br \/>\n[Gain: Magic Initiate + Rallying Voice]\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Return_to_the_Winter_People\"><\/span>Return to the Winter People<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>He returned to his people a changed man, nearly five and a half years later. He found his place had been taken by his younger sister. He no longer fit into the clan of his own people, and grew more despondent. He made the choice to leave his people, and fled to the lowlands. HE had not completed his training among his people, and he cannot seen the energies of FIRE and EARTH.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Leaving_His_People\"><\/span>Leaving His People<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>There he followed seekers, looking to escape The Oldening and make their way across the steppe to the south. They exploited him for his power to protect them, and after three attempts they finally made it to the free city of Cheril. There, he was robbed of nearly everything he had over time. Weakened and with his sacred bundle stolen and held hostage, he was forced into petty crime. He managed to recover his satchel with his people\u2019s mementos and escape. They caught up with him in the dark alleys of Cheril, and he barely managed to throw his satchel into the gutter before he was jumped and beaten by a gang of thugs. He was beaten and left for dead.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Montvin_or_Bust\"><\/span>Montvin or Bust<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>He eventually recovered and slowly traveled south towards Montvin regaining his strength and purpose. He learned of the cultures as he went, and knew that he would never fit in in the crossroads city of Montvin &#8211; though there was plenty of activity in the area to hire the like of him.<\/p>\n<p>MOTIVATION: The character is an angry one, looking for purpose and meaning, having suffered several let downs trying to make it on his own. He knows he has strayed for from his people, he no longer cares and sees the world as cruel and wants nothing more than power to be the master of his own destiny.<\/p>\n<p>DEATHS: Yeti Breath<\/p>\n<hr>\n<p>BUILD OUT: Start @2nd; +1 level for basic background; extended background to gain 4th level Feat Magic Initiate [Warlock] at 3rd.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Race: Human (native of Orlec) Class: [Storm] Sorcerer 5th HD: 4, 4, 4, 4, 4 +5 HP -1 Sacrifice to primordial elements = 19 -1 Ritual = 23 Essence: 31 -1 Strength [10] +0 Intelligence [14] +2 Wisdom [11] +0 Dexterity [12] +1 Constitution [12] +1 Charisma [20] +5 Sanity [13] +1 Proficiency +3 bonus [&hellip;]<\/p>\n<a role=\"link\" class=\"rtp-readmore\" title=\"Read more on Icrane the Sorcerer\" href=../../../../22http/incarnanet/host/kelly-berger/char/icrane/icrane-the-sorcerer/22_808848154.html rel=\"nofollow\">Read More \u2192<\/a>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"parent":6167,"menu_order":8,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":[],"categories":[],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/6957"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=6957"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/6957\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":6958,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/6957\/revisions\/6958"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/6167"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=6957"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=6957"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=6957"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
