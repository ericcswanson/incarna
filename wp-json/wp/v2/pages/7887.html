He and his companions had just completed a multi-year quest to catalog and detail the fates of the most ancient families of the Riverdans of Dunstrand. During this time, they had become patriots of the River Lords and Riverfolk.\n<\/p>\n<p>Tonnesbridge is the site of a battle in the Riverdan of Monaides of a dried up stream bed and a collapsed stone bridge that once spanned it. Pursued by enemies, Belim and his companions made a stand at this place &#8211; the only place that they could put their backs to for miles. They succeeded in killing their attackers and caused a mudslide that exposed an ancient troll cave on one bank. In it was a great deal of copper coins &#8211; a ton of copper. The site was named Tonnesbridge and a small villa was constructed. It was eventually where Belim chose to retire, and he founded the Tonnesbridge Vanguard. Their home is the Tonnesbridge Villa. It has a stables of some 20 horses, and a large hall and smithy. Outside of the stone villa walls is small set of farmhouses, a tavern, and boarding house.\n<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Rumors_and_Legends\"><\/span>Rumors and Legends<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>There has been repeated claims that the Vanguard members are one of the only means that the lords of the Riverdans interface with House Malor of Dunstrand &#8211; never in their short history has Va nguard members betrayed the trust of the Riverdans.
