The Council of Peace (also called the Council of Stillness) has sent word that they need aid from outsiders. This is terribly strange, as the council has not issued a statement in perhaps a thousand years &#8211; no one remembers the last. \u201cThe council seeks outsiders clear of mind and purpose to deal with supernatural forces it is unable to. Seek matriarch Veneveh, in the Birch Net Vale, in the south hinterlands of the Ghelmyr Forest of Ilyndra.\u201d Little else is known, but it has reached your ears by way of courier who says only a \u201clittle bird gave it to him\u201d (literally). Strange that it was addressed directly to you &#8211; you have never had dealings with the elves before.<\/p>\n<p>The forces that be believe that part of the weapon you need to defeat the rising evil is within Ilyndra. The elves there may be able to help you seek it out if a good turn is done for them &#8211; and so you are sent. You are told The Deeping is an uncommon term used to refer to some particularly nasty effects within The Underdark. <\/p>\n<p>The elves have prepared the way for you. Powerful magics of their Soul Tree will allow you to Tree Stride beyond the lands you are in, to theirs, instantly. <\/p>\n<p>We are discussing our next mission, walking out of a building.  An elf male approaches us, saying he was sent by higher powers (Pelor?) to assist us in our endeavor.  His name is Drayfala.<br \/>\nWe are searching for an ancient weapon that was dismantled and distributed to the 3 continents.  When combined, it can be used against Chromatic Dragons.<br \/>\nOur first stop is a town called Colville.  It is a trading settlement on the outskirts of the Elvin lands.  It is mostly humans and some elves.  It takes us about 10 days to get there.  There are lush forests surrounding the town and mountains rise up behind it.  We see signs for Derrington Valley, where Colville resides.<br \/>\nWe are not greeted well when we arrive.  Everyone is quiet and surly.  A man enters the inn behind us.  Dray makes eye contact.  He asks if he can join us.  He asks if we are passing through.  He is Mayor Steven     .  Modax says we are assisting the Cleric on a mission.  <\/p>\n<p>The Mayor tells us of recent murders and problems with the Elves.  Some of the townsfolk mutter \u201cwimp\u201d under their breath.<br \/>\nModax offers our services.  He looks as if he may have been an adventurer in his younger days.  The people are blaming the Elves for the murder of Ebear, a local celebrity and magic user.  There are also brigands that have arrived about 10 days ago.  Ebear defeated a man who threatened the town, then Ebear disappeared.<br \/>\nThe Elves live in the Enclave of Vilaframe.<br \/>\nHe offers to pay for our meal and rooms.  We will rest the night and start in the morning.<br \/>\nWhile we rest, Talia walks to the door of our room, and throws it open.  A maid is listening at the door.  She claims she is here to collect laundry.  We don\u2019t believe her, and she leaves.<br \/>\nThe night is quiet and passes without incident.<br \/>\nBreakfast is ready when we come down. Talia asks the barmaid if she knows the washer woman.  She does know her.  She asks if she makes a habit of listening at doors.  The barmaid says \u201cMy sister is nosey, but she means no harm\u201d.<br \/>\nWe go out to investigate the teamster\u2019s transport, where a murder occurred of a guard, by elven arrows.  The guard, Fritz seemed to get along well with the elves, helping them carry their loads back to their enclave.<br \/>\nWe go to the Teamsters hall and talk to his co-workers.  We don\u2019t really learn much about why he may have been murdered.<br \/>\nBack in the inn, we hear the tale of the travelers that were assaulted.  They were attacked by sprites, and elven arrows after dealing with the elves.  We are told the elves had taken their goods back.<br \/>\nWe decide to check out the farm house, where an entire family was killed. But first we spend another night in the inn.<br \/>\nWe break out some cards and start to play.  A couple people ask to join.  We buy them drinks. (10 GP, plus our losses at the game).  We hear a rumor about Cremoth Sithrine.  An adventurer sorcerer who threatened the town.  The town folk seem to think he was looking for an elven artifact.  Then Abear killed him.  They found his blood soaked cloak hanging from a tree.<br \/>\nAnother rumor relates to the possibility of a curse on the town.<br \/>\nIn the morning we head for the farm.  Dray says he thought he saw a couple of sprites.  We leave a sugary treat and see if they go for it.  One of them starts to eat, and calls over the other.  They are in a sugar comma.  Dray tells them that we wish them no harm.  We tell them we are going to the farm.  The sprites say that all the problems are because of the other (except elves).  We also offer them wine, which they drink.<br \/>\nThey tell us that the humans violated the sacred place.  The human leader came through the Black Grove.  The grove held an evil spirit that the elves had kept in check.  The humans camped upon this site and awoke the spirit.  The spirit has been attacking the elves.  The elves are upset with the humans for bringing this evil upon them.  They tell us we must go to the Grove and vanquish this spirit.  We leave them trinkets, and cloth (for capes).<br \/>\nWe go back to town and tell them where we are going and why.  Then we head back for the Black Grove.<br \/>\nMeena tracks ahead and finds a place with no birdsong. There is a strange tree in the grove.<br \/>\nBefore we enter the Grove, Dray casts Bless on Meena, Balder, Talia, and Modax.<br \/>\nAs Meena enters, the trees seem to come alive.  The lash out at us, but miss.  Dray speaks to them in Sylvan.  They seem to calm down a bit.  Dray leads and Meena follows also speaking Sylvan. The trees part for our party and let us through.<br \/>\nIn the center of the Grove are large leafy trees that block the daylight.  Talia can tell that there is something in the thicket.  Meena can tell that there are bats inside the grove.<br \/>\nIt is dark in the grotto, Meena, Balder and Modax head in.  We are attacked by stirges and are all hit.<br \/>\nModax casts Magic Missile and blows his off himself.<br \/>\nMeena tries to squish it, but can\u2019t get it off.<br \/>\nBalder fumbles and hits himself in the eye.<br \/>\nTalia shoots at them, missing.<br \/>\nDrayfala casts firebolt and destroys the stirges on Meena.<br \/>\nOne detaches from Drayfala but he squishes it.<br \/>\nA horned skeleton immerges from the darkness.<br \/>\nDrayfala notices an elf hanging from a tree with arrows sticking out of its body and slash marks on its body.<br \/>\nTalia hits it with the flat of her blade and hits.<br \/>\nDrayfala realizes that he can\u2019t Turn this creature.  He casts Spiritual Weapon.<br \/>\nThe creature attacks Balder, hitting him with his axe.<br \/>\nModax casts Magic Missile.<br \/>\nMeena attacks and hit with the flat of her blades.<br \/>\nTalia attacks with the flat of her blade, hitting it.<br \/>\nBalder uses his Breath Weapon.  Then he takes his action surge and swings with his great axe hitting it.  He heals himself with Second Wind.<br \/>\nDray casts Guiding Bolt, hitting him.<br \/>\nThe creature attacks Dray.  Meena misses her attack of opp.  It hits Dray.<br \/>\nMeena misses the first attack and crits the second attack.<br \/>\nModax sees the dead Elves start to animate and lets the party know.<br \/>\nBalder hits the creature.<br \/>\nDray tries to Turn the elves and they come towards him as if they are asking for release.  But they don\u2019t attack.<br \/>\nThe creature hits Meena and also Balder.  It roars again.<br \/>\nModax casts Magic Missile, and the creature dies.  The Elves fall also.  Dray blesses them as they die.<br \/>\nDray sees the ground swallow the skeleton.  He pours Holy Water on the ground and re-consecrates the Grotto.  We move the bodies and release them.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>World of Ph&#8217;yrin Tys! 11\/18\/15 Game Master = Kelly Berger The elves of Ghelmyr Forest of the Kingdom of Ilyndria have called for assistance.
