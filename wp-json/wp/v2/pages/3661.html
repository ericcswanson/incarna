Your dreams are unsettling however. The air is hot, and burning your throat. You find that you thirst uncontrollably. You desperately try and clear your eyes, but they are dry and burn like sand is in them. You continue to wake up, noticing that others in your group seem restless as well. You are all sweltering, soaked in sweat and throats parched from the dream. The cool night air draws you out. Long after midnight your party gathers in comfort. Wineskins are passed, and after a while pipes light up and deep breaths are taken &#8211; you all discover you have been having the same dream. Soon you all calm down, and begin to return to the comfort of your beds after laughing it off. Turning a corner, the stand of trees you just left are not there, and neither is your place of rest. Even the stars above seem foreign, and strange &#8211; forming a strange arch-like pattern you seem directly under.\n<\/p>\n<p>Take an accounting of what they have. Be realistic &#8211; most PC\u2019s don&#8217;t wander around with anything but a small, personal weapon.

You can see eyes reflecting light at the edges of your vision, and hear something akin to the whispers and what sounds like the laughter of children. A wave of vertigo overwhelms you, the ground seems to move under you and you fall. You roll to the ready, with only your night clothes and personal small weapons. Nothing is as it was\u2026 you are no longer in where you believed you should be\u2026 but someplace else, a shadowy reflection of that world, verdant and eerie.\n<\/p>\n<p>The Twilight Gate is a permanent sundering of The Pattern in which the &#8220;stars do not align&#8221; as they should and the normal course of reality is twisted, creating a gateway (under these misaligned stars) to a twisted place in either The Feywild or Shadowfell. The gate has been activated (by ancient eldritch incantations) by powerful Fey to send the PC\u2019s into.\n<\/p>\n<p>Distrust and violence are inimical to the Twilight Gate &#8211; the more weapons and armor the PC\u2019s take through, the more Disadvantage they will have.

He can be engaged and if the PC\u2019s are willing to talk with him for the 8 hours that he will go for (give them a chance to break it off each 2 hours), those getting to the very end will gain a +1 Lore in Elves and [rudimentary] literacy in Feyloise (\u201cconjugate the verb!\u201d). Each 2 hours though, every PC engaged must make a DC 10 Constitution check or suffer 2 damage and sleep for 2 hours &#8211; losing benefit of the teachings. At the end of the 8 hours too is an Awakened Shrub attacking for each PC, and a Swarm of Insects that will attack the area.\n<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"The_Long_Path_and_Arch\"><\/span>The Long Path and Arch<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<div class=\"bordered know\">The path winds and winds. Despite this lands ever-present twilight, the shadows grow longer and deeper. The trees begin to encroach on the path and the stars fade. Finally, up ahead, you see some sort of luminous archway. Getting closer, it seems as if the trees and brush have encroached on the archway, almost trying to blot out its light. The well-worn path leads straight under the archway. There is no movement, and no sounds other than distant insect and birds &#8211; the trees seem to cling towards the arch, not swaying in the breeze. <\/div>\n<p>The party can examine the archway from a distance. It appears to be made of crystals. A lot of the arch is rough and jagged (falling on it would easily case D6\/3 damage. All around it is the dead carcasses of insects. <\/p>\n<p>An Investigation DC 13 check can find 2 (1 check for each) shards that can be broken off and held without cutting the wielder. These function as normal daggers. Otherwise any shard used will also cause 1 damage per attack to the wielder if they do not have metal gauntlets or similar protection (Mage Armor will work).\n<\/p>\n<p>Anyone looking makes a DC 10 Con check (add dex if Investigation proficient); blindness for 1 hour (except stag helm wearers) from the reflecting light. If any character is blinded, the arch begins to strobe. This will cause a Swarm of Insects to come &#8216;investigate&#8217; (and attack the party).\n<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"The_Noble_Stag\"><\/span>The Noble Stag<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<div class=\n\"bordered know\">Continuing along the trail, ahead the trail widens to a clearing. A stag stands proud in the twilight, you can see his breath on the air. It paws the ground as you draw closer. The stag tilts his head back and sounds his challenge: \u201cYeeeeeeeehaw!\u201d His back legs kick and he twists and turns&#8230; reminding you of a bucking bronco. He finally stops his bravado display, the bright eyes turn to you\u2026 \u201cWanna go for a ride!?\u201d<\/div>\n<p><img src=../../../../22http/ihuffpostcom/gen/1350157/images/o-ELK-RUT-facebookjpg/index_1059788111.html alt=\"Elk\" style=\"width:200px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Jonzey Squirrel Skewerer is ready to buck and kick his way like a bronco to prove he\u2019s the baddest &#8211; and challenges the party to ride him to prove they are the \u201ctoughest buck of the woods\u201d. He won&#8217;t say much but his name and his \u201cgame\u201d &#8211; \u201ctake a ride on the wild side, baby!\u201d.<br \/>\nAttack: Jonzey is a hard fight if you want to get past by attacking him.\n<\/p>\n<p>AC: 13, HP 59; 2 attacks &#8211; gore 2D8\/9 and kick 2D10\/11; +6 attack\/+4 damage &#8211; Cannot be grappled. If a target is kicked with a 18-20 attack, they must make a DC 15 Strength save or knocked prone and take 1 level of Exhaustion for 24 hours.\n<\/p>\n<p>Ride: Only a single PC need ride the buck to settle his machismo fix. It always ends up the same for Jonzey though &#8211; dead. Each round the PC must make a DC 15 STR check or get bucked off &#8211; they can try and grab the antlers to hold on and will take 2 damage each time they do so. At the end of 5 rounds, Jonzey flies into the air, spins, and crashes down on the rider, breaking his neck in the process (he keeps trying to perfect this move, to no avail). This deals 2D8\/9 damage to the rider unless they make a Animal Handling check. His antlers break on impact.\n<\/p>\n<p>The stag has a lot of materials for those with a good Survival skill. DC 10 Survival &#8211; Sinew of the stag + root branch (found later) = bow (short) + cattail (found later) as arrows ; DC 14 Survival skill &#8211; Skin of the stag (cures overnight AC 12); Food &#8211; each PC can get a meal (or more with cooking the meat later); 2 points of healing per meal.\n<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"CuteyNymphy\"><\/span>Cutey-Nymphy<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<div class=\"bordered know\">The trail has been winding and dropping for few hundred feet, and up ahead, the twilight glimmers off a shallow, wide pond with cattails next to the trail. You are suspicious by now and slow, approaching with caution. As you stand a hundred feet away, pausing to observe, a small form leaps from the pool. In a flash a nubile teen boy looks over his shoulder and laughing, runs into the woods naked;  \u201cWeeeeeeee!\u201d, he yells as he runs between the trees. Like a predator with no control, you feel lust and a slavering hunger and fight the urge to drop everything and pursue him.<\/div>\n<p>Those PC\u2019s not compelled to pursue (or when they get back from the run) can make a DC 10 Investigation check to notice the strange cattails &#8211; they could actually be used as arrows for a bow (D6\/3 damage), or as light darts if hand thrown (D3\/1 damage). There are 24 total cattails here. <\/p>\n<div><b>Encounter: Pursuit<\/b>\n<\/div>\n<p>Each PC must make a DC 13 Sanity save or run in pursuit, revulsed at themselves if they do.\n<\/p>\n<div><b>Encounter: Ravine<\/b><\/div>\n<p>character falling in will die.<\/p>\n<div><b>Encounter: Hill Giant<\/b><\/div>\n<div class=\"bordered know-more\">\u201cGet away from him you bitch!\u201d says the giant figure.<\/div>\n<p>Additional Materials<br \/>\n<ul class=\"su-subpages pageList\"><li class=\"page_item page-item-3728\"><a href=../../../../22http/incarnanet/play/adventure/steel-realms-adventures/rivins-hedge-maze/pact-of-the-temple/22_1868970291.html>Pact of the Temple<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Dream and Twilight Gate You find that exhaustion overtakes you not soon after bedding down.
