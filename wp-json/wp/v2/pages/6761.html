Attunement is required, for both rings to both wearers; and is somewhat painful as the inner surface of the ring penetrates and bonds to the wearer\u2019s skin. Once per day (resetting at sunset) the wearers can adjust their stature toward each other. For example the larger wearer can reduce in size down to be equal with the smaller; the smaller wearer can increase up to the size of the larger, or they can \u2018split the proportion\u2019 in the middle. Due to the nature of the magical energies involved, the duration varies as follows:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Smaller wearer can become larger size for 1 hour<\/li>\n<li>Larger wearer can become smaller size for 2 hours<\/li>\n<li>Both wearers meet at their average size for 1.5 hours<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The effect requires the wearers to be within 50 yards of each other; otherwise they quickly return to their natural size. The effects do not confer any ability increases or decreases. The rings, being custom made, only work for those with statures between 5 feet and 12 feet.<\/p>\n<p>400gp from sun and life way house<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Wizard 4th [demon trained at 3rd] \/ Fighter 4th \/ Rogue 6th = 14th HD: 4,4,4,4 = 16 +4 \/ 6,6,6,6 = 24 +4 \/ 5,5,5,5,5,5 = 30 + 6 > Hit Points = 84 STR = 11 INT = 16 WIS = 13 DEX = 20 CON = 13 CHA = 14 SAN = [&hellip;]<\/p>\n<a role=\"link\" class=\"rtp-readmore\" title=\"Read more on Rivkin [5e]\" href=../../../../22http/incarnanet/host/kelly-berger/char/rivkin/5e/22_1778992663.html rel=\"nofollow\">Read More \u2192<\/a>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"parent":6673,"menu_order":8,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":[],"categories":[],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/6761"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=6761"}],"version-history":[{"count":20,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/6761\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":7564,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/6761\/revisions\/7564"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/6673"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=6761"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=6761"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=6761"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
