Before the battle, he prayed to the flames &#8211; the only place he had, to guide his balde against the magus Belwin, that the merchant house had hired to put down the peasants. A voice spoke out of the flames and said that it would aid him, but that his passions would in turn blind him&#8230; yet he agreed. His sight was forever altered by Merkaine, goddess of fire, and he became a mage-slayer. In the battle, de got close to the magus and unleashed his new found skills upon him &#8211; killing her and winning the day. Ultimately, his best friend betrayed him for money and his woman&#8217;s love and he was forced to flee. People died because of this, and he seeks to redress the balance.<br \/>\nDefining Event > I stole from a corrupt merchant to help the poor.<br \/>\nPersonality > \tWhen I set my mind to something, I follow through no matter what gets in my way.<br \/>\nIdeal > Sincerity.
