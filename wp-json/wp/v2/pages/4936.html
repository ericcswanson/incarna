Across from it, is a wall of squares 80\u2019 high and very thick &#8211; you would guess at least 4 feet thick. All at once a heavy fog materializes above the wall, dropping swiftly to obscure the wall in front of you.. A wall that begins to move and make sounds.<br \/>\n&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<br \/>\nModrones &#8211; the literal line of defense! The squares are all modrones. \u201cWake up, Wake Up! Potential Threat, Outsiders, intruders, strangers.\u201d<br \/>\n= heard behind the fog<\/p>\n<p>Cloud comes towards you, many voices repeating the same phrases and word in a crescendo.<br \/>\n&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<br \/>\nAssuming the PCs claim they are non-hostile (if they fight, they will die), the creatures of strange geometry will shout out \u201cINNNN-SPECTION\u201d!!!!! As many Modrones as there are PCs will line up opposite them &#8211; this should be a hint to them.<br \/>\n> One of the highest order Modrones will, with a syncophantic follower behind it saying \u201cyes sir, of course sir\u201d, etc. He will make many observations of their slovenliness, unkempt appearance, smwll, any small detail that can be made to be an issue will be.<br \/>\n> It will ask if they are a \u201cunit of true serving soldiers or base vile mercenaries\u201d?<br \/>\n> Assuming they go with the flow, the modrone will ask \u201cPerhaps you are replacements?\u201d<br \/>\n> Well then protocol has not been observed. We have set aside a barracks for you. At the start of a new cycle time, we will review your squad.<br \/>\nThis will give PCs opportunity to address all the wrongs and failures of inspection.<br \/>\nInspection<br \/>\n\u201cYou know what to do!\u201d Eyes forward, chin straight, shoulders back, etc. etc, etc.<br \/>\nDC 10 check for each; they need 70% success rate or they will be detained.<br \/>\n&#8212;&#8212;-<br \/>\nCHA check &#8211; How you hold yourself, posture, etc.<br \/>\nWIS check &#8211; Perception to notice blemishes, imperfections, etc.<br \/>\nINT check &#8211; Military lore to know where and how all dress items, weapons, etc are placed and worn appropriately.<br \/>\nNew Recruits and the Send-Off<br \/>\nThe modrone Secundus will declare them \u201cFit and ready for duty!\u201d There will be much argument about what to do with them. The do NOT FIT. Literally, their geometry does not fit on the wall. They must be replacements for minions of one of the guardians!

They will be given a red sash and a baton, and weird stretchy hat.<br \/>\nNo matter what they say, they will be cheered.<br \/>\nIf the speech succeeds on a DC 15 Persuasion check, clouds will rumble overhead at the high point of the speech then dissipate and light will shine down brightly on the speaker.<br \/>\nModrone Road March<br \/>\nFarewell and Something\u2019s not Right<br \/>\nThe Modrones assemble around you, creating a pathway down which you march. They close ranks as you pass, and as you lean forward into some unknown force, you struggle. You march for several minutes into a bright light, comforting and with a cool warmth. You feel pressure ahead of you, and force your way through some invisible membrane after minutes of long effort. The singing and cheers fade behind you. You are suddenly afflicted with great pain! From every direction where an item of violence or war is upon your person, and then it is suddenly gone.<br \/>\n&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<br \/>\nEach PC takes base damage from every weapon they are carrying. While they are in the land of six circles, these wounds will not heal except through natural passage of time.<br \/>\nIF their leader who spoke at the New Recruit rally successfully, they gain resistance to each type of damage they suffered!<br \/>\nThe Long Road<br \/>\nThere is a road that constructs itself as you march. Forward and forward, one step after another. Miles and miles pass and all you hear after a while is the sound your feet make as they propel you. Hour after hour, step after step\u2026 it could be days, you are not sure, but your mind and body both scream out in pain. You refuse to give in to the strange horizon &#8211; you sense an alienness all about you, and the self building road  lays brick after brick in silence. The horizon is almost impossible to even contemplate. Nose to the grindstone, you look only at your next step, wondering if the road will fail to appear as you demonstrate ultimate trust in the mechanism carrying you forward\u2026 but is it responding to you, are are you being herded? Its your last thoughts you fall asleep while marching&#8230;<br \/>\n&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;<br \/>\nSAN check DC 12 = equiv of long rest if failed SAN check<\/p>\n<p>Road to Six Circles<br \/>\nAs you shake you eyes clear you stand on a vast road. The mile wide road twists onto its side and rises into the air, circling around a column of witch-light\u2026 you sense raw power &#8211; an anima fountain. The column and road-ribbon stretch into the distance &#8211; days of march are laid out before you. It is confusing and the dimensions are alien and strange. There is no sky per se, and no passage of a sun &#8211; though there are times when the \u201csky\u201d is darker but it never gets completely pitch dark. All around you you can feel a pull, trying to tear the island of order apart in a massive whorl of chaos. You sense the ribbon protects the anima fount with a bulwark against the forces of entropy all around you.<br \/>\n&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<br \/>\n> DC 15 Perception: It wraps 6 times total, creating 6 different \u201csections\u201d. Each one take 12 hours to travel through normally as you estimate distances\u2026 but its not fully comprehensible what you are seeing, your mind reels under the strain. Colors coalesce and shift, blend and rip apart &#8211; outwardly there are appears no consistency or pattern. <\/p>\n<h1><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"ESCALON_%E2%80%93_The_Land_of_6_Circles\"><\/span>ESCALON &#8211; The Land of 6 Circles<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h1>\n<p>The order of the sections changes as the PCs encounter them and march through them &#8211; roll D6 randomly until all have been encountered.<br \/>\nIt mimics one of the outer planes in places scattered across each land; if you are not already of that alignment you will feel a pull.<\/p>\n<p>The Messenger<br \/>\n50% before starting, 100% after first encounter that a mephit will appear and say:<br \/>\n\u201c6 lands beyond the wall of Modrone there be.
