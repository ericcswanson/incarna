The Ducateon tend to bring the others with them, creating communities in-balance with their larger or diminuative cousins that can be used for the greater benefit &#8211; Kobolds often working smaller materials easier with their smaller appendages, and the larger trolls carving out the passages and underground cities faster. This controlled breeding often ends in the Trolls growing angry once the major digging is done and fighting for their freedom as opposed to being bred out of existence. Kobolds typically continue to work in harmony (to some degree) with their smarter cousins, but also often break free of their breeding programs and are more likely to dwell on the surface, seeking the patronage of darker gods and entities, and are drawn to their ancient blood ties to dragons where they can be found.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Dumastorians are a primary set of a humanoid species characterized as dwelling underground, their digestive processes (sugar and fungus processing, selective\/limited in bacteria), carriage (squat, dense, powerful), sight (ultraviolet spectrum, near sighted), and tunneling\/digging capability (claws which heal fast, and can tear through stone).
