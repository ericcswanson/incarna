You obvious demonic heritage meant you were recruited by the priesthood of the elemental adepts&#8230; and ultimately by the forces of darkness for a resurgence of cause. In a massive battle, you fought against a host of invaders and were caught in a backlash if one of the temple&#8217;s altars being defiled and destroyed. Into the pit you fell for day and woke up under a strange dual-sun day. You hiked until you came to the coast and fell exhausted. You woke up next on a cart. The folk of Wolfnor took you in, showed pity on you, and nursed you back to health. They gave thanks to a clan of cloud giants that protected them from the inland tribesmen &#8211; and the air and sea were their sacred elements. Your fire veneration was not beyond their ability to understand, especially once they understood your nature. Your nature changed once you found acceptance with a good people. You defended the village along with the people against the Cazua (sea raiders) and a few times against the tribesmen of the plains&#8230; long side the silvery cloud castle that brought the Cloud Giants. Over the last 10 years the assaults have grown more violent and larger in numbers. Wolfnor is 650 + 200 in hamlets outlying.. it was assaulted finally by a horde of thousands. The cloud-folk did not come&#8230; someone or something sabotaged the normal mechanism used to summon them for aid. You were caught in a fire and knocked unconscious when the building collapsed. You awoke as many survivors were leaving with a band of wanderers &#8211; headed to Shadowby and seeking a way up the slopes of the Grey Peak mountains to access the silver cloud that is the cloud giant&#8217;s home. <\/p>\n<p>Jack Vi\u2019Medj (Arabus)<br \/>\nGnesh (Rocky)<br \/>\nKayle (Duncan)<br \/>\nPrykevagen (Danny)<br \/>\nKampfer \u2013 Firbolg Wizard 2\/Warlock 2 (Kelly Berger)<br \/>\nAerik \u2013 Human Eldritch Knight (Earl Clark)<br \/>\nAdokul Forgedawn \u2013 Teifling cleric of light\/fire (Neel Dey)<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>9\/2017 Tiefling Cleric 3rd; War Domain STR 14 DEX 14 INT CHA CON 17 WIS 16 SAN 11 Proficiences Weapon Proficiencies: Martial; Simple Armor Proficiencies: Heavy; Light; Medium; Shields Language Proficiencies: Common; Draconic; Elvish; Infernal Powers Darkvision: 60 ft.
