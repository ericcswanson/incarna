Perhaps they are echoes of what once truly was, or an idealized form of a journey that folk would make related to the physically connected item or place. A Trek has no specific goal that must be achieved, only that the experience must be endured. Often times, the content of the experience is either positive (dreamwild) or negative (nightmaria) based on perspective; For example, a dream of the hunt is the character chasing down their prey, while a nightmare is the character being the prey (or having the roles reversed during the hunt). A positive trek is meant to drive and inspire a seeker, a negative trek is meant to dissuade and stop a seeker.\n<\/p>\n<p><b>The Check<\/b>: Navigation is the only successful end result &#8211; experiencing the entire journey. In order to do that, the characters make a check or series of checks based on ability and skill. Most usually do not require specific powers, but may have such options if appropriate.\n<\/p>\n<p><b>The Results<\/b>: The experience feels very real and visceral in a dream-trek, though those experiencing it cannot die as a result of a individual failed trek. Dream Treks do not take more than a single moment of real-time to experience, though hours or months may pass in the journey.\n<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Success<\/b>: The character gains some broad inspiration, insight or knowledge related to the anima&#8217;s source, or a clue\/hint to unlocking some specific related mystery. <\/li>\n<li><b>Failure<\/b>: Failure is usually represented in one of 2 ways as the failure is experienced over and over in their mind for 1 day: Temporary Sanity loss, or a cumulative level of Exhaustion. <i>Critical Failure<\/i> can result in a permanent loss of Sanity.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Example_Aethereal_Treks\"><\/span>Example Aethereal Treks<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"The_Hunt_Aether_Trek\"><\/span>The Hunt Aether Trek<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>This is about a hunt to forage or scavenge for sustenance and refreshments.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"pos\"><b>Positive<\/b>: The hunt is grand and the finest beast\/target of the hunt is available.
