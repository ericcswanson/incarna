He is keen to always be on the side of life and and nature, and sees himself as a defender against the cancer and corruption of evil. As a warrior, he views himself as the one who must make the tough decisions, which sometimes seem crude or repugnant in fighting evil. He always goes for the most powerful of foes &#8211; groups if possible, using both weapons. He prefers for others to do direct engagement if he can maneuver to strike from the flank or behind in single foe fights. Against groups, he is the wall against which they break and will be in the middle.<br \/>\nArmor: Breastplate<br \/>\n   > Resilience = 2 (Breastplate 2; -1 Result Shift \/ 1 less Armor Class)<br \/>\n   > Armor Class: 15 [armor]\/16 [Dex +1]\/17 [style]\nWeapon(s):<br \/>\nHand axe (for throwing 30\u2019 or melee)<br \/>\n   > Attack bonus = +6<br \/>\n   > Damage = D6\/3 + 4 for strength = 7 simple\/ 10 full \/ 26 critical<br \/>\nBattle Axe and War Pick<br \/>\n   > Attack bonus = +6<br \/>\n   > Damage = D8\/4 + 4 for strength = 8 simple\/ 12 full \/ 20 critical<br \/>\n        (axe can be used 2 handed for 9 \/ 14 \/ 24 damage)<\/p>\n<p>Spells:<br \/>\nSlots = 3; 1st x 3<br \/>\nEnsnaring Strike<br \/>\nhttps:\/\/dnd5e.fandom.com\/wiki\/Ensnaring_Strike<br \/>\nHunters MArk<br \/>\nhttps:\/\/dnd5e.fandom.com\/wiki\/Hunter%27s_Mark<br \/>\nHail of Thorns<br \/>\nhttps:\/\/dnd5e.fandom.com\/wiki\/Hail_of_Thorns<\/p>\n<p>HISTORY<br \/>\nBackground: Outlander (outcast)<\/p>\n<p>Kemeri<br \/>\nRogue 1st\/Wizard 5th [Enchantment]\nHuman, female, 5\u20196\u201d, 147#, pale skinned, red hair [shaved close], right handed, light brown eyes, age: 24<br \/>\nHD: 8, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4 +6 = 34<br \/>\nEssence: 21 &#8211; 5 Occult Aptitude, -1 Coven<br \/>\nBackground: Sage<br \/>\nStrength: 9<br \/>\nIntelligence: 17<br \/>\nWisdom: 12<br \/>\nDexterity: 16<br \/>\nConstitution: 13<br \/>\nCharisma: 10<br \/>\nSanity: 12<br \/>\nProficiency +3 @ 6th level<br \/>\nSkills: Arcana (INT), History (INT), Sleight of Hand (DEX), Investigation (INT), Perception (WIS), Stealth (DEX)<br \/>\nTools: Thieves Tools,<br \/>\nAbility\/Saves: Dexterity, Intelligence<br \/>\nLanguages: Celestial (literate), Animal Mimicry, Dundarum (literate), Feyloise (literate)<br \/>\nEquipment<br \/>\nItems: robe of scintillating colors; characters recheck init averting eyes (blood bond)<br \/>\nMagic<br \/>\nOccult Aptitude 1 \/ Mana 4<br \/>\nFeat: Glamour of Violence<br \/>\n> Caster may use Suggestion to a) Provoke a willing target to Rage a number of times in a Long Rest equal to their Proficiency Bonus; b) Gain Advantage on any chance to resist charm or sleep; and c) 1\/Short Rest may, as a Reaction, dispel any fear or fright effect.<br \/>\nFeat: Essence of Reflection<br \/>\n> when u use Hypnotic Gaze, get a mirror image (max = int bonus for 1 minute)<br \/>\nCantrips: Prestidigitation, Light, Dancing Lights, Firebolt (2D10\/11)<br \/>\n> Occult Mirage<br \/>\n1st: Hideous Laughter, Charm Person, Mage Armor, Detect Magic, Sleep, Color Spray, Alarm, Silent Image<br \/>\n2nd:Hold Person, Darkness, Invisibility, Suggestion<br \/>\n3rd: Glyph of Warding, Fear, Protection from Energy<br \/>\nTactics<br \/>\nCreate a perfect silent image of a shield man with spear with a glowing tip to draw attackers away from party.<br \/>\n= saw a vision of faith = makes it perfect!<br \/>\nRitual of the Dark Sun<br \/>\nCharacter can cast Contagion 1\/Long Rest<br \/>\nCharacter can cast Hellish Rebuke 1\/Short Rest \u2013Damage is cold, does max.
