Came into power in about 9125 and peaked around 9130. For many years was the maker of princely armor and chief arcanist of the Thanes of Kaald. He identified many old kingdom magic items and enchanted a great deal of <a href=../../../../22/items/armor/22_762717010.html>armor<\/a> with minor enchantments as presents from the Thane\/Princes to favored hirelings and henchmen. He also had an extraordinary reputation for being able to ADD enchantments after the fact to existing [house and family marked] armor and weapons. It was said he had gave up Essence to discover the means of fast-working existing armor and weapons to add minor enchantments using elemental fire and earth power and a little blood of the intended beneficiary.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"bg-info\">\n<p><b>Mechanics<\/b>: Impress a simple +1 to existing shield or armor; Limits = in 50 years the enchantment fades. His additive spell protections and enchantments (he used 1-3 standard ones) are also weak and faded after a similar time. 1 in 20 of these would destroy the target object. That would do 1 HP permanent damage to the beneficiary the blood was taken from. <i>To especially favored vassals, he applied a standard enchantment to an item that would make it immune to cold damage as long as it was in the Hinterlands. This also attached an enchantment that caused it to absorb the first point of cold damage from every attack (on in the Hinterlands).<\/i>\n<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Alarm Spell: If ever anyone but the owner donned the armor an Alarm spell would trigger for 1 min.<\/li>\n<li>Dancing Lights: 2\/short rest Dancing Lights can be triggered that starts centered on the armor and lasts for 1 min.<\/li>\n<li>Feather Fall: Can be triggered by the wearer mentally 1\/long rest for 1 min.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/div>\n<p>He was rumored to have retired in in 9149, at a very young age. It is said he sometimes lives among the Ducateon of the north, where he learned to work with the massive ice lizards from beyond The Blue wall &#8211; making tough <a href=../../../../22/verse/set/steel-realms/items/armor/index_1410289507.html>quasi-scale armor<\/a> at the weight and encumbrance of light leather (this was a signature piece of armor for him). The armor was said not to fare well in warmer climes. <\/p>\n<p><b>Legacy<\/b>: He has several apprentices, some soldiers who would go on to distinguish themselves in the north, some who would take up the craft. His belief in a unified north was manifested most in his later days devotion to Thane Logoss&#8217;s attempt to unite several territories in a defense agreement &#8211; and seemed close to doing it, even forces that would normally be enemies. He had a pair of enigmatic Ducateon apprentices off and on; they were virgin brothers and only operated with tools that had been forged in fires started by wood from lightning struck trees.\n<\/p>\n<p><b>Mark<\/b>: His mark was of a dragon wrapped around an upside down forge. He never over-stamped existing items, usually stamped his mark opposite. A heavy chain link or 2 was attached to any existing object enchanted, as the binding symbol and magic focus. If ever this was broken or fell off the enchantment would fade instantly.\n<\/p>\n<div id=\"popmapsrlm\" class=\"hidden\"><a href=../../../../22/wp-content/uploads/srlm-map-handgif/index_1662929950.html><img src=../../../../22/wp-content/uploads/srlm-map-handgif/index_1662929950.html alt=\"Steel Realms Map\" lazyload \/><\/a><\/div><div class=\"modal fade\" id=\"basicModal\" tabindex=\"-1\" role=\"dialog\" aria-labelledby=\"basicModal\" aria-hidden=\"true\">\r\n    <div class=\"modal-dialog\">\r\n        <div class=\"modal-content\">\r\n            <div class=\"modal-header\">\r\n            <button type=\"button\" class=\"close\" data-dismiss=\"modal\" aria-hidden=\"true\">X<\/button>\r\n            <h4 class=\"modal-title\" id=\"myModalLabel\">Modal title<\/h4>\r\n            <\/div>\r\n            <div class=\"modal-body\" id=\"myModalPop\">\r\n            <\/div>\r\n    <\/div>\r\n  <\/div>\r\n<\/div><script>jQuery(\"a[class^='dndclass-cleric'],a[class*=' dndclass-cleric']\").prop(\"href\",\"\/characters\/class\/cleric\");jQuery(\"a[class^='dndclass-fighter'],a[class*=' dndclass-fighter']\").prop(\"href\",\"\/characters\/class\/fighter\");jQuery(\"a[class^='dndclass-ranger'],a[class*=' dndclass-ranger']\").prop(\"href\",\"\/characters\/class\/ranger\");jQuery(\"a[class^='dndclass-barbarian'],a[class*=' dndclass-barbarian']\").prop(\"href\",\"\/characters\/class\/barbarian\");jQuery(\"a[class^='dndclass-druid'],a[class*=' dndclass-druid']\").prop(\"href\",\"\/characters\/class\/druid\");<\/script>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A maker-wizard who makes pacts with fire and earth elementals to infuse armor with powers.
