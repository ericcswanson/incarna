As Orlec was gradually explored, the rolling grasslands were found to have seemingly glacially carved shallow valleys &#8211; perfect for drainage and crops. A few families settled near the watering hole . The natural spring became the center of a village of a few hundred over the next 10 years. Travelers and natives alike were treated with suspicion until multiple generations had been born &#8211; up until that point, violence was a daily occurrence in the village. Over the next 50 years, the town expanded from its center &#8211; the spring became a well and a main thoroughfare was made for caravans and travellers to get to it. Its now a major trade stop with routes east to Hiddzwaur and the coast and north-south across the plains. It is self sufficient in terms of food and water, but produces scant in the way of textiles or any other goods in abundance. It has antelope, grouse, grain, orchards, berries, fishing on the coast, and the cleanest water in a 100 mile radius. It now supports a large population which continues to grow. The \u201cFirst Three\u201d are the first three families and considered the founders. In reality, they were the strongest nomad bands that controlled access to the water, and fought for generations between themselves before dividing the land up to live in peace. They control most of the power, but now do so easily and without fighting. Most folk are multilingual, with it being a trade crossroads. There has been incursions and pressure from Merowey to the north, but kept in check with the threat of the Dorathian heavy cavalry and combined mages and priests that come to the cities aid when needed. The city has more open ideas regarding magic. Several mages have made their home in the city due to its friendly policies. Also, there is a major temple to Medja that celebrates life and nature. Over the last 20 years, a small tribe of orcs that were living in the Gangred Forest, southeast of Dorath, were assimilated into the population. Along with a band of halflings, and several small bands of freebooters and misfits have generally given rise to a diverse and spread out population. Several farms, steadings, and homlets exist with the 50 mile radius Dorath claims, all happy to have its protection and pay taxes, but far enough away to have their own space and beliefs.\n<\/p>\n<p>Final population: 13,000 (after 250 years)<br \/>\nNotables: Nicholas the Magus, Erik of the Temple of Medja, and the Bladesemmer &#8211; the school of caravan guards.<br \/>\nRector of Law: The high civic judge: Oversees the Hall of Balance &#8211; where three judges serve and criminal\/legal proceedings are processed.
