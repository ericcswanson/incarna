I am the beast, I am what brings nightmares to you! I am\u2026.NO ONES LISTENING!!!?????&#8230;.I AM&#8230;GOING&#8230; to get drunk. Hey ladies! Ever seen a lute played with a schlong?&#8230;&#8230;\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Background: Entertainer (Gladiator Variant)<br \/>\nPersonality Trait: Wants to be the focus of attention, even in combat. Always looking for that \u2018special someone\u2019. (if asked EVERY girl is that special someone).<br \/>\nIdeal: Beauty in the world. Like music, everything has a rhythm and poetic nature within. Even combat.<br \/>\nBond: Family, never had one, but it is best to be someone they could be proud of.<br \/>\nFlaw: Cant stop chasing the girls. Every chance there is.<\/p>\n<p>An orphan, born into the \u2018finkbonner\u2019 trader family, but left under the care of a family friend while mother, father and far elder brother went to the frozen north for what was supposed to be a highly profitable venture. The family friend was a veteran from the war with the gwinnish, and a zealous practitioner of Mizeras. War, conflict and rage describe childhood.<\/p>\n<p>The trade chosen is that of a blade for hire, as long as the client seems like a chump. This leads to the ring. Every match has silvers gambled on it worth as much as 50 times the prize money. Being the indestructible brute brings coins for nothing more than playing the part and striking non vital areas, and allows for massive gains with the occasional loss to the  \u201ccourageous\u201d  underdog. <\/p>\n<p>Life is fairly easy, wounds are minor when they happen at all, and the coins are more than need be spent. The regulars appreciate the fact that gentle nature and musical tendencies are the natural inclination, and the intimidation wrought from the ring discourages would be trouble makers.The song, the drink, the drugs, and the LADIES!!!!!!!!!!, can all be appreciated.<\/p>\n<p>Ego thwarts all. A fellow entertainer, of small stature and limited charismatic skill, issues public challenge. For the sake of the show the challenge is accepted, with the understanding that the challengers victory is imminent, and the blow must be convincing while allowing for a comeback. The blow is not false, threatening life. Time for recovery is needed, the show moves on.<\/p>\n<p>Pursuit of the show is possible, but seems empty. There have been no challenges of late. Even the one who brought ruin only managed a strike because it was allowed to happen. The ring is not the path any more. There are those here, they have seen and felt the pain. Perhaps they would appreciate the skills and tenacity presented. And if so &#8230;Perhaps another chance to be recognized\u2026..<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>[ Baggage Train Character for the Blackwells 2019-2020 ] Race: Human Variant, Fandelok Local Class: Fighter, Brute 4th level HD: 10,6,6,6 +12= 40 Essence 22 [11&#215;2] Sanity 11 [+0] Strength 16 [+3] Intelligence 9 [-1] Wisdom 10 [+0] Dexterity 12 [+1] Constitution 16 [+3] Charisma 10 [+0] Proficiency +2 bonus @ 4th level Skills: Acrobatics, [&hellip;]<\/p>\n<a role=\"link\" class=\"rtp-readmore\" title=\"Read more on Andy Finkbonner (Mandollin) &#8211; Character\" href=../../../../22http/incarnanet/host/troy-lancaster/chars/mandollin/22_1701781608.html rel=\"nofollow\">Read More \u2192<\/a>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"parent":369,"menu_order":47,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":[],"categories":[],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/2146"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2146"}],"version-history":[{"count":2,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/2146\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":8044,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/2146\/revisions\/8044"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/369"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2146"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2146"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/incarna.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2146"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
