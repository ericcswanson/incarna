The idea was that instead of, or in addition to a large barn for animals, a tower of stone could be used as a defensible alternative. This was typically a larger first story with a small cellar and a second story. A tapering column was at the center, at the bottom was a fireplace (the center column would radiate heat), and a stairwell wrapped around it going up.\n<\/p>\n<p>When not used for defense, it was used for storage and for drying and curing operations. They were also predominantly used as a pen for the farmstead\u2019s hounds. At night the hounds were allowed to roam free in the tower and a rotating handler would sleep with them. It was nearly impossible then for the Orrish to try and secure the position without being scented and attacked by the notorious <a href=../../../../22http/incarnanet/verse/set/steel-realms/places/heartlands/umbak/history/hearth-hounds/22_141570871.html title=\"\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"\" class=\"\">Hearth Hounds of Umbak<\/a>.\n<\/p>\n<p>But in the event of an attack, the servants and livestock could be moved into the tower base (which had no windows) and the second floor used for defense (arrow slits,not windows) and sleeping quarters. Crop tailings and grindings were often stored in a bin, to be mixed with dung for drying to burn in the advent of a siege.\n<\/p>\n<p>Weapons, oil, and armor were often stored in locked crates on the second floor. The tower had a massive barred door at its base (some had only doors which were pinned in place &#8211; not hinged), with a few had a portcullis that would drop in place in case the wood was burned. The roof was pitched slightly and the chimney top vented and covered, but usually had rooftop access and metal grill. Crenelations provided good protection at the top, which usually stood about 25-30\u2019 above the ground. These were made to withstand short sieges with livestock providing most of the sustenance beyond a couple days. They were expensive to make, and no steading would have more than one (a community project). Even in a village, only the wealthiest family may have one of these.\n<\/p>\n<p>It is said that the design and inspiration came from the church of Ikribu, the maker. The basics were simple, and most did not have a true chimney or battlements. The design was continuously improved on until they became as tough as nails, a virtual tiny keep. With that the costs rose until it became nigh impossible for it to be used for its original purpose. Over time, it returned to its simple roots and is still used today as a simple place of refuge for storm or raid.Culturally, the Umbakians prefer the greater space and single use organization as opposed to the cramped quarters and multi use of space these require\u2026 but nothing beats them for an emergency situation.\n<\/p>\n<p>Where the Umbakians left these behind, they are mostly dismantled over time for their cut stone. Most are rough cut, they are not meant as decorative and are pure function.\n<\/p>\n<div id=\"popmapsrlm\" class=\"hidden\"><a href=../../../../22/wp-content/uploads/srlm-map-handgif/index_1662929950.html><img src=../../../../22/wp-content/uploads/srlm-map-handgif/index_1662929950.html alt=\"Steel Realms Map\" lazyload \/><\/a><\/div><div class=\"modal fade\" id=\"basicModal\" tabindex=\"-1\" role=\"dialog\" aria-labelledby=\"basicModal\" aria-hidden=\"true\">\r\n    <div class=\"modal-dialog\">\r\n        <div class=\"modal-content\">\r\n            <div class=\"modal-header\">\r\n            <button type=\"button\" class=\"close\" data-dismiss=\"modal\" aria-hidden=\"true\">X<\/button>\r\n            <h4 class=\"modal-title\" id=\"myModalLabel\">Modal title<\/h4>\r\n            <\/div>\r\n            <div class=\"modal-body\" id=\"myModalPop\">\r\n            <\/div>\r\n    <\/div>\r\n  <\/div>\r\n<\/div><script>jQuery(\"a[class^='dndclass-cleric'],a[class*=' dndclass-cleric']\").prop(\"href\",\"\/characters\/class\/cleric\");jQuery(\"a[class^='dndclass-fighter'],a[class*=' dndclass-fighter']\").prop(\"href\",\"\/characters\/class\/fighter\");jQuery(\"a[class^='dndclass-ranger'],a[class*=' dndclass-ranger']\").prop(\"href\",\"\/characters\/class\/ranger\");jQuery(\"a[class^='dndclass-barbarian'],a[class*=' dndclass-barbarian']\").prop(\"href\",\"\/characters\/class\/barbarian\");jQuery(\"a[class^='dndclass-druid'],a[class*=' dndclass-druid']\").prop(\"href\",\"\/characters\/class\/druid\");<\/script>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The tower stables were a design popularized by the Umbakians in their constant conquests and attempts to colonize.
