They reproduce through parthenogenesis. The concept of a &#8220;mate&#8221; is merely a misunderstanding and assumption by other species. Dragons band together to insure the survival of the species and collaborate in raising young dragons. Beyond this, some dragons have been known to form bonded pairs, but this should never be considered a familial unit in the typical sense.\n<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Relations_with_Others\"><\/span>Relations with Others<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Bound_to_The_Dreamwyld\"><\/span>Bound to The Dreamwyld<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Dragons all go through a phase of their life in which they do not &#8220;sleep&#8221; per se.

Young dragons aften do this on accident, older ones can control it. This cloud of dreams manifests around the living, and forces them to relive the last moments. It often reflects the motivations and emotions of the dragon from with the breath came at the time of their death. It is described as a small demi-plane or world unto themselves that retells the story of the victims.
