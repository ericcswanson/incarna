Anything else is a distraction and disrespectful to everyone else. Sit with the group so that making checks can be observed and its easy for the GM to address the group. If its not possible, make sure you can show those nearest the results of making checks if needed with a minimum of movement &#8211; i.e. roll on a book you can pass to the nearest player to witness.\n<\/p>\n<p><b>Making checks<\/b>: You must have clearly marked indicators. If digital, the display must be viewable from all angles. All &#8220;dice&#8221; must have a high contrast between the numbers and background &#8211; i.e. white dice with black numbers. All resolution checks for players are to be made only on a character&#8217;s turn or when GM specifies, where people can see them. The spirit of this is to avoid questions of integrity and confusion in order of action, and make sure the GM and Party are all aware of each party members and opponents actions.\n<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>For % dice rolls, <b>there must be a distinct tens (with double digits) and ones (single digit) dice<\/b> or be declared ahead of the roll.<\/li>\n<li>If you have multiple attacks or multiple checks for the same thing done in one roll, specify which dice is first. A fumble generally precludes any more actions so you must be able to determine which order they resolve in. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Kelly_Berger%E2%80%99s_House\"><\/span>Kelly Berger&#8217;s House<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>THE TOP LEVEL IS OFF LIMITS.
