<div style="background-color:lightblue;">Chronicles of the Gallantine &#8211; Blackwell Days</div>
<p>Note: &#8220;Blackwell&#8221; is the equivalent of &#8220;Smith&#8221; in Dunstrand/heartlands of Gladnor<br />
<i>Tarmysian Tests is just one branch of a long line of multiple generation (in-game) character families and groups. The campaign has run for 15 years, since about 2004. &#8220;Gallantine&#8221; indicates an affiliated group related to an ancient band of bannermen named &#8220;Gides Gallants&#8221; that eventually cemented their bonds the the nobles of western Dunstrand, and eventually the Duke of Dunstrand. The group was given a charter with tax revenue and all, establishing an academy for martial training and elite forces for the Earldom of Bar-Innis. </i></p>
<div class="know">Blackwells&#8230; the unknowns, the generics, the anonymous. The Gallants &#8211; a band of Bannermen sworn to the Earl and Duke have sponsored their fallen foes in an attempt to leverage the prowess of the Black Hound mercenaries they defeated. A lot has been said, a lot of rumors abound, there can be no denying that the squad commissioned as &#8216;Blackwells&#8217; has come to the Barony of Crestwold and stirred the proverbial pot in service to the local Baron and ends unknown&#8230; assumed to be related to the mission given to them by their parent Gallantine group. The Barony, in addition to being in active war with the occupying Gwinnish of Tarmysia, finds itself in the middle of a strange war between phantasmal warriors of two forces&#8230; the sea queen goddess Elancil and some ancient Bronzemen ghosts. A trade war between smuggling factions and legitimate inland organizations, the meddling of the druids of Pranin Moorswood, and a persistent presence of the Lightbringers investigating dark forces at work nearby (and trying to establish a larger flock). Monsters, ghosts, demons, villains, and political stresses&#8230; hidden libraries, sunken cities and the gods themselves meddling in the affairs of Crestwold and the southern territories of the earldom of Bar-Innis. A sick ruler, a barony torn apart by strife, a seeming impending clash between the Lightbringer faith and House Malor (the Ducal Wizards of Dunstrand).

</ul>
<p>Two favored bands of warriors&#8230; one a ruthless mercenary band bought by Gwinn to defend a critical part of their captured lands in Dunstrand on the Tarmysian Peninsula. The other the bannermen of Dunstrand, looking to retake lands held by Gwinn for a generation. Both of them strangely having a core group venerating Merkaine the fire goddess &#8211; so far from her northern stronghold. This was one of many oddities that made this battle one for the ages. Both had supporting auxiliary forces, but a core of more than 200 soldiers on each side. The Black Hound Company had about 150, while The Gallants had only 50&#8230; but the Gallants had loyal auxiliary in their strange scouts, allies from Dogwood Flats (it is said that they used Goblin skirmishers under the cover of darkness!). </p>
<p>The Black Hounds were holding the right flank of the Gilman Pass known to the Gwinnish forces as &#8220;Dead Man&#8217;s Peak&#8221;, but The Gallants had better intelligence and moved under the cover of darkness and smashed into them at dawn. The battle was desperate on the slopes, and the Black Hounds even managed to bring up another 25 reserve troops in training from their base camp, but the outcome was already written. The reserves were slaughtered &#8211; only a single one survived. The Black Hounds made a last stand and alerted the main Gwinnish forces before their position was completely taken by 8am. </p>
<p>The main Gwinnish forces at the top of the pass were able to retreat back into Tarmysia and not be cut off, but the unraveling of their position at the pass was complete. Nine months The Gallants had worked to insure their smaller force would prevail and victory was theirs. After the invasion of southern Tarmysia failed, the lost honor had been regained &#8211; though at a high cost. Only around a score of the Black Hounds had been taken captive &#8211; the rest fought to the death. Gwinn is a tough master, but the Black Hounds had gotten rich in working for them. The threat of ever being recaptured after surrender meant most would rather die. Gwinn was not known for being very forgiving&#8230; unlike the Duke of Dunstrand. And so, a few of the Black Hounds, even some of its officers, either took a chance or were too wounded to fight and were captured. </p>
<p>The Gallants had lost a hundred auxilary and half their number in the fight. With each campaign, their numbers are dwindling sharply. Their main recruiting base, Dogwood Flats and the earldom of Bar-Innis were too depleted. The word went out of their victory far and wide though &#8211; that can be assured. The Black Hounds went from being a full mercenary company known from Beryl to Karolak, to nothing more than a memory. Its remnants awaited their fates in prisoner camps on the edge of the Scar Flow in the earldom of Richfield, or, at best to be shipped with nothing off to the southlands or perhaps even Northgate Garrison to fight in the frozen north for the High King against the Lich Lords.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, news was coming in from the north to the Gallantine Academy at Dogwood Flats. The small band had gone north to ensure the well being of Jaq &#8211; one of their senior officers who had been cursed by their enemies (so the rumors went) &#8211; had been slaughtered. The pressure on The Gallants was mounting &#8211; assassination attempts on Mary, attrition in fighting, and now direct opposition to their efforts in the north. The leadership made a bold decision to make a once in a life time offer&#8230; to its defeated enemies. </p>
<p>Feather was sent to speak to the remainder of the Black Hounds. The offer was simple&#8230; join and gain your freedom, or have everything taken from you and be cast adrift&#8230; after years in a prison camp until the end of the war. A few rejected it, but about a dozen proved interested. Feather tended the wounds of those interested using her strange magics. A history lesson was given &#8211; the civil war of Bar-Innis, the quest for the Rosewood Vase, the Holy Wars of Hareen, and the long running feud with the Twin Rivers powers and Umbak&#8230; a lord (Earl of Bar-Innis&#8230; a woman, no less!), a cause (bannermen to the Duke of Dunstrand), a family (The Gallantine &#8211; death, duty, honor), and the mission &#8211; that they seemed uniquely qualified for. </p>
<p>Those that accepted would be rebranded The Blackwells (a generic last name in the heartlands for bastards and orphans) &#8211; in honor of the most ruthless Gallantine general that ever lived &#8211; Geraldine, who gave up her last name and titles in the nobility of Bar-Innis and took on Lady Blackwell as her name. Evil, ruthless, protective, and in the end willing to sacrifice herself for her &#8216;family&#8217; against a wretched Lich &#8211; a legend known for a thousand miles in every direction. </p>
<p>Rumors say the Gallants are forming a group to rescue Jaq Blackwell &#8211; a senior company member who also gave up their heritage and adopted the generic last name. Like her predecessor, she had a known history for absolute steadfastness, mercy, and sacrifice. Key in defeating Umbak, the saving of the Golden Child, and in directing the efforts to heal the wounds with its southern neighbors she has risen swift in the ranks. The was known for her swift violence of action to resolve situations. She bore the strange sword Bone Shaker &#8211; said to be from another world. And something happened to her.. rumors say she was cursed by her enemies. And so, as the Gallants never leave anyone behind, they attempted to save her. A trip to the north&#8230; the far, far north. Into the lands of the Lich Lords the rumors went. Definitely beyond the civilized places and into the wilds. And so about a dozen of the Black Hounds were finally accepting of taking the company oaths after days of healing and discussing. </p>
<p>Feather is their patron &#8211; she is a Lt. now in The Gallants, and the commanding officer for their group. What the Blackwells know about her is that she is related to Geraldine in some way, or perhaps to Mary (the leader of The Gallants &#8211; she throws little clues but nothing concrete, not answering questions directly), she knows the ways of magic, seems at home with a curved blade she carries, and is passionate about her life in serving The Gallants. She even admits that a gallows would have been her ultimate home were it not for finding a place with The Gallants. She is odd, young, filled with energy and does not seem to ever sleep. She claims that she sees &#8220;old school&#8221; Gallants in your band (there seems something sinister in the way she puts it), and that that particular brand of violence, single-mindedness, and a willingness to do what needs to be done is what is needed. </p>
<p>You set off for Cabella and the nearest port, and learn of the civil strife in West River (the local baron has been ousted&#8230; and there is something to do with the Baron of Richfield and the Gallants have given the family that fled safe harbor. Making the well known and powerful count of West River County an enemy was not something you signed on for, but seems to come with the deal. Despite the differences, the group is escorted quickly into the seas off the coast of Cabella, and smuggled from there to the great and powerful merchant city of Karolak. </p>
<p>However, the Cabellan privateers alter the course, and you are woken in the middle of the night &#8211; back on the Cabellan coast instead of to the merchant cites and freelands as you thought. The Gallants were said to have strange allies, but now the real extent of this is revealed. Hybrid animal-people take you swiftly back into the hills around Gillman Pass, and down into the Barony of Richfield under cover of the dark and a fog that Feather seems to be the source of. From there, skiffs meet you at the edge of the terrifying vast Dwindor Swamp. A group of men wearing the livery of the Baron of Richfield drops off supplies &#8211; food and water. You are covered in sack cloth and have no idea where you are or for how long you travel &#8211; at least 4-5 days. You are reminded constantly of your new oaths&#8230; no one leaves the Gallants except feet first. Surrounded by decaying swamp, theres nothing to really contemplate except your own breathing.</p>
<p>Shaken, you arrive on an island surrounded by strange creatures. There can only be one answer as to whose home you have come to &#8211; the Witch of Dwindor. Feared by everyone, there are many, many dark rumors surround her. Said to be immortal, they is in fact terrifyingly beautiful, celestine even in her appearance. And, Feather seems to know her well&#8230; even laugh as they talk in a language none of you understands. The Witch is said nominally to be an ally of Dunstrand &#8211; in the sense that there is a peace now, after the Umbakians were held fast in Dogwood Flats and the crusade there stopped. It was said the Witch of Dwindor even brought the fog that aided the landing last year in south Tarmysia (though the attempt to take it back failed). </p>
<p>Pops is chosen to lead the group &#8211; his experience and knowledge will hopefully prove a good choice. </p>
<h2><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Operating_for_the_Witch_of_Dwindor"></span>Operating for the Witch of Dwindor<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>
<p>The Witch peers intently at your group. &#8220;Your name is to honor Geraldine. I knew her. She was a potent enemy and had a strength and cunning in her that none (to thier never ending shame) predicted. I will do what Feather has asked &#8211; your journey to the north will be swift and direct. In return, i ask for the head of Harumein &#8211; a hag of the north. Don&#8217;t worry, she is already dead, and her head is held as a trophy by someone you must get it from. All will be made clear in time, of which we have little as the moon is cresting now. Go with your name and do death and mayhem upon the enemies of The Gallants. Our fates are now intertwined.&#8221; </p>

The witch wants to use the Gallants in exchange for what she is doing. I make sure Pops knows where his allegiance is. I get my own private debriefing later from the four who went on an errand for her.<br />
The group of 4 went after a box that the witch needed. They had the skills, but did not trust the ranger&#8217;s assessment. They went far up the road and infiltrated the town. They took a chance and tried to come up behind it on its way to the crossroads. The scout ambush was botched and a signal arrow sent up. They had to let the enemy scout escape and get in front of the cart (armored to prevent fire and gain some slight cover). The ambush was impromptu and fast. Star used magics to grease the road and the horse panicked and cart tipped. Tellip lead a contingent of them away after taking out the Water Witch of the Band O&#8217;liers. </p>

[FEATHER&#8217;s JOURNAL]
Whatever the witch retrieved from the Band O&#8217;liers in Tarmysia sure made her nervous. She yelled and argued with Feather and demanded the use of the Gallants again. She took a band of three of them out to some remote place in the swamp &#8211; right on the Edge of Scar Flow where the ocean could be seen again. It looks like the place was recently uncovered &#8211; Feather says there have been some earthquakes in the area. The skiff is towed by giant bats, A day travel &#8211; with the witch herself. Anyway, an amphitheater like area was flooded and there was a cave. In the cave was a giant scorpion. Pops rammed his shield onto the stinger and it spared the Gallants from the worst of the poison. Helluva  time to kill it though. Then the back pudding &#8211; Crow would have died were it not for the dumb creature dropping on him in water &#8211; where its corrosion was weak. Then there were the red lights &#8211; weird fire beetles. And the strange writings, and broken temple. &#8220;Apshai&#8221;. Undead and a &#8220;hive&#8221; as Tellip put it &#8211; ant men bustling with activity. So.. the ancient Birthing Caul of the temple of Apshai was busy again. This was bad&#8230; like way bad. Like maybe only the Once King could possibly be worse. Apshai is one of the places where sacrifices were made in the thousands to the sea-queen Elancil. Souls went to feed the made experiments of the Sea Kings. And now its going again&#8230; who the fuck is in charge? What if no one is? Is that worse? I&#8217;m not sure how the Blackwell crew made it out with the information they did &#8211; but for damn sure they are Gallants, no other caliber could pull that off. </p>

[FEATHER&#8217;s JOURNAL]
What. The. Fuck. Time and our people are running out. The bitch, i mean witch, needs The Gallants for another mission. The fucking deal gets worse all the time. I send three of them in. Pops, Sole and Duck. Apparently something is invading the witch&#8217;s sanctum and she needs help. Thats pretty serious. She wont let me me in, but i tell Pops what to look for. Its a crystal cavern under the swamp. Theres a man, with his face flayed off, and under some heavy runes carved around him and on him. The crystal spider is going for that as a target. So, someone tries to kill Mary, our forces in the north are attacked directly, our recruiting grounds are dried up, and someone is attacking the witch of Dwindor directly? Some deeply disturbing shit is happening. It phases in and out of ethereal and attacks from all sides. Duck is poisoned, but they kill it. The witch wont say anything about what they saw, but she&#8217;s got some skin walker magic going on. Crystal is filling Duck&#8217;s vein &#8211; the witch puts in some sort of catatonia.</p>
<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="The_Poison%E2%80%99s_Cure_for_Duck"></span>The Poison&#8217;s Cure for Duck<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
<p>The witch says theres a place we can get the poison&#8217;s cure &#8211; or she can cast a risky enchantment. Theres also a less sure way &#8211; some of the Gallants go herb hunting just in case. Two are sent, including Crow and High Brow. Into some fallen temple or some such &#8211; the witch says all will be made clear. Once again the skiff is towed by giant bats &#8211; it goes a long way in a day of travel. The witch is not present this time. It turns out this temple is thousands of years old &#8211; a Lightbringers temple, a place of some sort of refuge from the time of Dunstrand Vale. Phantom identical twin warriors, hounds from the Feywild, and an old school Spirit Web all mask the home of some sad, gibbering puddle of goo creature. Its actually some sort of a test, and theres a golden, glowing strange beast that safeguards it. Anyway, the tests are done and it gives them a potion. </p>
<h2><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Finding_Ashfall_Hollow"></span>Finding Ashfall Hollow<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>
<p>Jingle is brought in to the court of the Witch of Dwindor… we thought we were going to be sent north to help a group of Gallantrs there. A couple of the Blackwells are hurt and are resting, we have to recover first before we go. It turns out something came up and we are being sent into the sout of Bar-Innis… along the edge of the swamp. Its about 4 days travel time. Some big hole has appeared, pretty strange by all accounts. Our mission is to investigate it. </p>
<p>The journey takes us a day only. The giant bats of Dwindor, like they have for some of us already, pull us throughout the day and night, tethered to the skiffs. We rendezvous with a halfling merchant vessel out of Loamwald. It makes its way to To__ Ford &#8211; where the river forks. We step off the dock to a lively bustle for such a small place of 3000 people &#8211; the capital of the Baron of ___. The harbor master is not surprised to see us &#8211; he was warned apparently. He sends us on our merry way to find quarters. Everyone in town is armed, and its obviously overloaded. All the Inns, bed and breakfast, and rooms for let are taken. We persuade one group to move out of a barn so we can fit all seven of us in. </p>
<p>The town was on fire. Lots of activity. There were several bands of mercenaries or adventurers in and many locals flocking to see what would happen. The sinkhole was 25 miles away, on the edge inside the Calibars Slurry. Resources were scarce. We split into 2 groups to get information and travel to the site.</p>
<p>Troll Hunters of Sweetwater. Twelve went in, three came out. Dwarf, half elf, halfling. 2 [dwarves] drowned in accident.  Maybe not so accidental? We found out later that they pulled out treasure, perhaps there was an attempt to make it a three way split instead of 5. In town we talk to a lot of people but no one seems to have a lot of information. We do find the following groups in town: Morgan Barflys (A dozen idiots from Morgans Bend), the Ditch Witches: 7 (5 hard women and 2 men); “no boats” but from the merchant cities (plain and simple they were almost all killed on a boat fighting, once a company of 2 dozen) – holding court at Keith’s Cup<br />
Bellvins Brace: 4 old timers (seasoned veterans) – they have already bought 2 skiffs and been out to the area once. LAstly the ‘Georges’ &#8211; lead by “handsome” George, and the Banks End Pipers: 8 from Karolak area that were traveling south and heard about it. A lot of talk but no action. The 2 in town catch up after the rest of us make camp on site at the sinkhole. Bellvins Brace is hired to watch our backs. </p>
<p>In the camp, we find we are not welcome, and yet everyone wants to see us go in and try. Strange noises, moving shadows, and the evil feel of the slurry keep folk at bay. There is an archeological expedition from Umbak who gives us some knowledge &#8211; the place is a Bronzeman enclave known as Ashfall. Its important, a center of their famous weapon making. It helped bring down the Temple of Apshai &#8211; the place some of us had visited in Dwindor Swamp… a place that had rose from the deep after thousands of years. Coincidence? After consulting with a few people we decide to go in. Durrgo is able to get close enough to an edge of the sinkhole without being pulled over. He covers us with a crossbow as the rest descend. Shadows move strangely and at the bottom the rushing water into the sinkhole prevents much in the way of talking. A strange long arm, connected to a clawed hand &#8211; like a trolls &#8211; attacks from beyond the wall of water as we descend, but never pursues us. In the hollow, the musd and running water make movement difficult. Many broken trees delineate paths, three forge centers and a small town’s foundations are all that are left. We explore one area and are attacked by evil tree-like creatures. </p>

Ashfall has been left for a week, and permission is given to explore again. You are one of 3 groups given permission. There are trade disagreements to be settled, a score with a duelist, new friends to court and intrigue and local politics which continue with or without you around. Which will have priority?

<h2><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Sponsorship_and_Pugilist_Tournament_in_Crestwold"></span>Sponsorship and Pugilist Tournament in Crestwold<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>
<p><!-- Game day 1/28/2018; posted feb 4th, 2018 by Arabus --><br />
As written by Pops:</p>
<p>Regular record keeping is not my strength, my notes will be brief and to the point. After Billy lost his duel against Rollz we considered killing the villain in his sleep, but decided against it to preserve our own reputations. We reported to _______________, our representative from the Morban Brothers. We have decided to back them in the current merchanting dispute against Tolmens Guide. It seems that after our failure to make an example of Rollz there is little we can do. ____________, says that we could represent the Morban Brothers in the upcoming pugilism tournaments, a local yearly tradition.</p>
<p>On top of this request is another from the Mayor&#8217;s aid, who informs us that people are sneaking out to Ashfall, and the phantom soldiers have started marching again. The mayor wants us to go out and stop unauthorized people from approaching the pit. We agree to take care of this, coming up with a solution to accomplish both tasks at once. Pennies will be our unarmed champions in the tournament (we considered and dismissed using Moon), while the rest of us travel to the road leading to Ashfall. We use Blevins Bracers to cover the northern road while we cover the southern. To keep Pennies safe while seperated from us we speak to ____________, and she agrees to have the Barley Brothers attend to him.</p>
<p>We set up a checkpoint before Ashfall and begin to warn people away. It takes some effort with a few but most seem to get the point. One group, Banks End Pipers, approaches and gives us no warning, they just charge. It could’ve gone badly, but no one was interested in dying over this so only fists were used. We thrashed them effectively and sent them back. The next group was more eventful. The Morgan Barfly&#8217;s had bolstered their numbers with thugs who rushed us drawing steel. I yelled a warning and pulled my spear to me via my weapon bond, then used my powers to blind the thugs. The others beat the thugs heavily and the Barflys said they wanted nothing to do with this, leaving.</p>
<p>At this point we got warning from Belvins Bracers that a couple groups have made it to AShfall, one of them being a group led by a renowned warrior from another Barony. Moon, Billy and Sunny stay behind to guard the road while Crow and I go to Ashfall to attempt to convince people to leave. The leader of the group, Camlin, quickly sees the issue and agrees to post a mile from Ashfall and keep people away, He also aids us in getting all the other Mercs and treasure hunters out. We head back to Pennies</p>
<p>Pennies was doing well, and had been winning his fights. Between one of his tournaments he and the group are approached by 2 women who want aid in shutting down a brothel that is using an illegal drug to keep their girls pliant. After some discussion it is clear that the issue is that one of the women&#8217;s daughter had been enticed by the lure of easy money. Rather than getting involved Pennies spoke to the Mayors aid and quite quickly the daughter was no longer working at the brothel.</p>
<p>Pennies remaining fights went quite well, even increasing our coffers a bit as the group gambled on the outcome. In the end Pennies was the Dead Ringer champion, and took it a step further, attempting to fight an expert of the Elon, who were renowned for being professional boxers (and dirty fighters). Unfortunately, Pennies could not deliver a decisive enough blow to the Elon Champ. Hanging on by a thread for what seemed an endless reign of blows he pushed the Champion to his limit and was defeated. Despite this he had gained quite a bit of respect and our representative informed us that we had done everything she felt we could. Knowing this, it was time to go back to Ashfall.</p>
<p>On the trip to Ashfall we discovered that 3 Mercenary bands had been raiding small hamlets, apparently looking for something specific, not just looting. Especially since they had paid for everything they had taken. They are holding the people of Hotherwale hostage and are making no efforts to parley or negotiate, only shooting and capturing anyone who approaches. We convinced Camlin Forak of Lilymarch to join us, as well as going to a local authority who gave us the legal go ahead to raise a Levy and liberate the town. Now we march, gathering intel and formulating our plans as we go.</p>

<p>+1 Day<br />
Camlin leaves to set up a picket around Ashfall to the north and east. The Barons forces grumble &#8211; unhappy with not seeing action and getting glory. He is leaving in 2 more days. A runner arrives from Torrelsons Ford from Josey Warrin and she is asking for help. The group has asked for a week off and will use it. Tellip is sent ahead &#8211; he can get top Torrelsons Ford in a day. He gets there and tries to find if some big event has triggered a change. Only that less lights are being seen in Tarrins Vale. Tellip spies on Joesy, see Lucky, follows him to a abandoned building he never leaves. Tellip plays dice, notices 2 new halfling crew members &#8211; young ones with a distinct tattoo they are trying to cover up on the back of their wrist. The abandoned house has a distinct knock and he trails one fo the new halflings to it. They exit later and their is something different about their life force aura his undead eyes see. Later he notices they look 20 years older. There was some sort of ceremony on the Red Pony &#8211; Lucky&#8217;s ship (though he was not around). Tellip warns the group off entering town.</p>
<p>Billy Boy is following Camlin &#8211; Camlin is taking him on as his Page and will be sponsoring him in a knightly order and training him to duel if all goes well in a year or two. </p>

<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Pops_Entreats_with_House_Malor"></span>Pops Entreats with House Malor<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
[This is not known by the group &#8211; not recorded at the time because House Malor asked for secrecy]
<p>Its no secret &#8211; Tal Beckham runs the shop of Diamond Curios and Antiques @ Torrelsons Ford. It is not really disguised well and most people know who she works for: HOUSE MALOR. She is from the Riverdans (accent is thick), is now about 50, was once freshly beautiful, and now her and her dog keep watch over an aging shop.<br />
> Diamond Curios and Antiques: This is an interesting old shop, and collects and sell both Dunstrandian and Umbakian antiques from local areas and sells them mostly to outsiders. Its rumored to be a meeting point for academics, and said to be connected to House Malor.
</p>
<p>You know me as Pops, as a representative of the Black wells, and as a wielder of magic. I have no interest in avoiding you or trying to hide myself. My name is Mica Falnoth, I am a descendant of a prominent noble house of the Gwinnish empire.I have served the interests of the former ruling cast and the goddess Elancil. My mind holds secrets I doubt anyone in the mainland knows. Thanks to the Emperors betrayal of us (reveal scar on my neck), my order was destroyed. I can offer you this knowledge, hopefully to be passed on to the Duke. The catch is that I remember little since my betrayal. I want my history and life back. I want to be free of the those who betrayed me. If you can help me find a way to obtain this without losing the powers that keep me safe from my enemies then I offer every bit of knowledge hidden in the mires of my mind.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tal nods her head and they begin to discuss some things. Exactly what it is unknown. She puts Pops in contact with Sira Winstone of Mev, senior brother of House Malor in Bar-Innis. You have dream sendings from Sira Winstone. He has a way to completely restore your memories. You have to come to Mev though.
</p>

<p>The party is asked to gain some evidence from a scribes office &#8211; also private records archive. Its to implicate someone high up in local politics in colluding with her competitor. They talk wife of younger night guard to distract him for 100 silver. Make it look like smash and grab simple theft, avoiding traps and replacement guards. They find a note making her rep. of LEague of White Lily, naming her contact in Mev, and granting her a 1000 silver line of credit. The record they are searching for is written in a cipher. They give it to Josey.</p>
<p>They go to pick up the arms shipment from the Red Pony and local fishermen stop party. Supplies are lean, and local mercenaries are threatening to take tomorrow nights catch. </p>

<p>They hear rumors the baron&#8217;s son or daughter is sick&#8230; The orchards in the villa are having efforts doubled to grow them faster &#8211; apple, pear and plum for 500 silver more.</p>
<p>+1 Day<br />
The Baron&#8217;s agent asks the party to run a patrol east of Krellian. There have been reports of the phantom soldiers appearing in the area, though the site is secure and nothing should be triggering that. </p>

[Pops&#8217; experience only]
<h4><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Everything_Goes_Haywire"></span>Everything Goes Haywire<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h4>
<p>House Malor senses the powerful connection to Elancil and watches Mica closely. When Mica comes to them for assistance, his case has already been discussed. The order decides to use The Rosewood Vase, recovered from the Band of Crows expeditions, to restore his memories and gain insight into what happened to the order in a way not one living person can. They hope it will reveal strategies and plans Gwinn has for Tarmysia.
</p>
<p>Pop and Fish meet in the basement of the curio shop. Theres a secret chamber under it, and you are aware of additional ones but are only allowed to see a few.
</p>
<p>They bring out a wooden chalice, inscribed with floral decorations and runes around the base. It smells of rosewater. They tell you to drink and be reborn.
</p>
<p>House Malor uses the vase and Mica drinks from it. Immediately alarms go off to all nearby White Sisters &#8211; a great disturbance has been made. Mica’s memories come back in a swell of violence.
</p>
<p>All hell breaks loose. In the ensuing battle, Pops kills one of the House Malor guards, kills one of the House Malor initiates, and kills Fish. He finds a tunnel that leads to the river, and escapes in the freshwater &#8211; as close to the welcoming sea as he can get. He drowns, but Elancil is not done with him. In death, he forgets the entire experience, but she breathes life back into him.
</p>
<h4><span class="ez-toc-section" id="After_Fish_is_Dead"></span>After Fish is Dead<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h4>
<p>You wake up and you are not sure where you are at. Your mouth and lungs are filled with sea water, and you retch it out. You remember the cold sea. You remember the young halfling ship captain fishing you out of the water. You vaguely remember some faces, and some of it comes back to you. The faces, the battles, the Black Hounds. You kind of remember a battle, and a woman in a swamp, and a deal. The rain is cold on your face. It tastes faintly of salt. How is that? The wind sounds like a woman’s laughter&#8230; like the evil laughter of the bitch goddess you are bound to. Fuck. Where are you? You know who you are. Your clothes are dirty. It is dark out.  You are on the banks of a freshwater river (how did salt water get into your lungs?), the lights of a town about a half mile away. You pick yourself up and walk as the sun rises. People look at you strange, and you ask where the Black Hounds are camping. No one knows them, but they do know the Blackwells. You think that might be it. Staggering into a familiar looking Inn, following the smells of food, you see faces that look familiar. Everyone stops and stares. People you believe to be your friends rush over to you. Everyone wants to know what happened, but you cannot tell them. Who is Fish? He&#8217;s missing. Where have you been? You don&#8217;t know &#8211; apparently you and fish were to keep things secret with something you were working on and no one knew where to look. You settle in. What the fuck is going on? You don’t know. You sense gaps in your memory, but cannot remember who you were with. A full belly and a warm fire and you fall blissfully asleep, unable to keep the fatigue at bay. You are picked up and moved into the barn where the Blackwells are preparing to set out soon. No one can wake you up when the bad news comes in. You awaken later, a little more clear headed, but confused. The Blackwells you have some memory of, but not clearly. Everyone is looking at you strangely. The body of Fish has been found. Further down the river, a merchant&#8217;s bodyguard found him when he went to refill a cask with water. There are marks on him that are clearly burns from magical powers, and holes from a spear thrust. Fuck. Someone does not want you to remember something.
</p>
<p>Pops thinks to himself&#8230; So not only do i not remember what i was trying to get back but i also have lost a chunk of my memories since the accident? Fucking awesome.
</p>
<p>Pops does not even know that he was trying to recover memories previously and House Malor made him and Fish swear to secrecy, so no one but them knew what was going on &#8211; the rest of the party only knows they were working on a secret project. No one tries to contact Pops&#8230; like as in House Malor or the authorities. Pops is laying low with the Blackwells. &#8220;If my memory is supposed to be gone i&#8217;ll pretend it is for a while, and if these guys are supposed to be my friends i need to re-acquaint myself.&#8221;
</p>
<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="The_Witch_Sends_Word_About_Fish_and_Pops"></span>The Witch Sends Word About Fish and Pops<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
[To Bailyn/Tellip only]
<p>You get a message by magical means from your patron, the witch. &#8220;What in the fuck has that man Mica done!? There was a flash, and lightning ripped out around Apshai temple in Scar Flow. I sensed the presence of not one, but TWO GODDESSES trespassing personally in my domain. Elancil from the sea and Aerna from the sky. For a moment i could see your friend from a hundred miles away, bright like a shining star. Whatever you are doing, STOP. Death follows in its wake.&#8221;
</p>
<p>House Malor reaches out to Bailyn and Cameron (&#8220;Crow&#8221;) and request that they work with them to track down Pops. They dont give much of an explanation other than he is a fugitive, dangerous, and has killed some of their number and was responsible for the death of Meb/Fish as well.
</p>

<p>Crossing the cavern chasm, Pops falls and hit his head &#8211; all his memories flooding back. He attacks the party. Immediately 2 are swept over the edge and fall to their death from a Thunderwave.
</p>
<p>So Coffee and Sunny-Side split to avoid grouping. The bottle of chloroform was tossed, missed, caught by Sunny-Side, tossed and missed again. Pops misty stepped across the 20&#8242; chasm. He then tried to throw his spear which would become a cloud of daggers and missed.  Coffee and Sunny flee to the back of the cavern on their side. Pops finds cover in the dark on his side. Coffee runs and kicks the lit torches on their side into the chasm. He begins a slow trek on the narrow ledge. A bad wind almost takes him off the ledge he is stealthing on. He stops and switches to bow. Sunny lights and throws a torch. Coffee shoots a bow, hitting Pops. Pops runs for the opposite side, and kicks the torch into the chasm. Back and forth it goes, until Coffee tries to rush Pops position defending the ledge where it opens into his side of the chasm. He fails to push pops back to make room. He grabs Pops and jumps off the ledge. Pops uses his last misty step and returns to the ledge as Coffee falls to his death. A quasit comes out of nowhere and attacks Pops, doing poison damage. It uses a spell attack as well, but Pops kills it. On the other side, an insane man attacks Sunny-Side from out of the darkness and after trading attacks for several rounds, he kills Sunny Side. Pops makes his way to the outside of the cave. On his way out, he is hit by a critical shot from an arrow, from some unseen foe, but still manages to break free. Thats the end of the immediate battle.
</p>
<p>Pops manages to get out of the caverns of Bromei. He waits, hoping to ambush whoever shot him, but they do not materialize. He slowly makes his way to cover. He is instinctually drawn to water, to try and make his way to the sea. Under cover of the dark, he hopes to follow the slurry to the sea. The going in rough, but he slogs through it. During the night, the strange phantom soldiers attack him &#8211; a loyal servant of Gwinn now. This gives away his position. Morning comes and Pops is confronted by the reborn ghoul-Bailyn. A symbolic clash, Bailyn manages to distract Pops while House Malor, lead by Star and 2 apprentices, secure his capture. He is knocked down by the hunter Mark Smith who is following him. He tries to enact the power of Elancil directly, and fails &#8211; he is captured at last. He will die under interrogation under conditions that no one knows much about except House Malor.
</p>
<h4><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Pops_Captured"></span>Pops Captured<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h4>
<p>Somehow they know where he is likely to be, rather than trying to track him down. They confront him. Crow and Mark Smith, a militia commander from Rakefield who tracked Pops from the Caverns of Bromei take down Pops with arrow fire while Bailyn concentrates on keeping Pops engaged until Hosue Malor can capture him alive after Mark Smith rushes him and knocks him down. Bailyn, Star, and Crow offer Mark Smith admittance into the Blackwells, and find out about the death of the others.
</p>
<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Blackwells_on_Trial"></span>Blackwells on Trial<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
<p>The news has spread across the length of the barony the group has been betrayed! The rumors abound with the specifics, but only those who were there know what really happened. House Malor was involved directly, the soldiers of Crestwold turned out on the road to Torrelsons Ford in force, and the port locked down for three days. The surviving members have been corralled at the hamlet of Caravel East &#8211; east of Torrelsons Ford. Militia and soldiers nervously keep an eye on the remainder and their allies while the Baron and House Malor decide their fate. They are allowed no visitors, no fires, and no mounts. As the third day of deliberations passes, dark storm clouds gather overhead. In the late afternoon, the Blackwells announces the addition of two locals to the group (a hunter from Rakefield, and troubleshooter from Torrelsons Ford), and the addition of a member of House Malor as well as a strange outsider from the ranks of the allies of the Josie and the Morbin Brothers trading interest. There are more new members than old &#8211; the betrayal of Pops nearly destroyed the band. Rumors fly through the camp that the baron has relented and their freedom is nigh. Rain begins to fall as night closes in, and a cold fog rolls in from the north, where the sky has opened and begun to dump vast quantities of cold rain.
