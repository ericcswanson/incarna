				<div style="color:red">This is an adventure summary. There is little to not statistics included in this. It is the skeleton of a set of scenarios which are not fully formed or detailed &#8211; it can be used as an easy to follow pattern and inserted into almost any campaign. </div>
<p>SETTING: <a href="host/gary-bishop/dnd/phyrin-tys/index.html">Ph’yrin-Tys</a><br />
LOCALE: Starts in Portent Downs; runs mostly in Dobenwaald Reach; ends in Portent Downs</p>
<p><b>Gazza Characters</b>: Drafala retires to contemplation in the nearby temple for 60 days. Karandaman is recently in from the south and has heard Spider&#8217;s crew talk about the party and wants to get to meet them. He is seeking a group to sing of &#8211; high adventure, heroes, powerful folk doing great things!
</p>
<h2><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Following_in_the_path_of_Comrades"></span>Following in the path of Comrades<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>
<p><b>Setup</b>: Raxhanne has, with the immediate help of Spider Brah, gone in search of demon blood. Her patron has told her that if she finds this, she will attain the needed knowledge for a magical item to increase her powers. She has, soon after the party reconvenes after the last adventure, gone missing. Teppo, one of Spider many lieutenants, tells you that Spider gave to her an old book about a temple to a strange god &#8211; long ago abandoned and buried, in the hills 2 days west of their current location. Its a days hard ride, and another hard day trek into the steep hills. Teppo remember s as he was the one who made the contact for the map from their sources, and verified it (he does not look like a literate person!). He can try and redraw the map and the directions from memory (DC 10 Intelligence; he has a 12 Int)
</p>
<p><b>The following is a dream of Raxhanne&#8217;s siblings</b>.
</p>
<p class="know bordered">About three days after you return, into your rest period, you both begin to have disturbing dreams. By the fourth day, you have talked about it. The dreams are vague, there are a lot of birds, or at least beating wings, covering you. You wake up panicked each morning, unrested.
</p>
<p>If they ask, the characters are NOT REGAINING SHORT AND LONG REST POWERS. If the characters try in any way to seek out the meaning ahead of time, then let them work through it to lead them to her being in danger, and the wings are some sort of clue. Give the group as a whole, a PLOT POINT. On the way to the encounter location (<a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B9bXnBqx_iE9WVl2MHlOeS1BVkU">Adventure A Week &#8211; Temple of Sanctuary</a>), they will encounter swarms attacking them.

<p>Teppo will re-draw the map from memory. For Every point of the DC missed, add 2 hours for the characters to search for markers and features described by him.
</p>
<p>The journey is about 35 miles &#8211; a full day of hard riding. At least 15 miles is Difficult Terrain if the characters have to make it by walking. If any character has a Constitution of less than 12, they automatically take 4 HP of fatigue damage; double if they are not using mounts and wish to push themselves to get there at the earliest opportunity.

<p>Curse afffected characters will feel their limbs get heavier here as the sun gets closer to setting if the group rests before continuuing on. This will give them a hint at what might happen &#8211; another cumulative level of exhaustion (up to 3 so far).
</p>
<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Inside_Temple"></span>Inside Temple<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
<p><b>General Changes</b>: The ceilings are 30&#8242; tall in all corridors and rooms &#8211; domed.<br />
<br /><i>The Vrock will attempt to fly over the party if it is trapped in one of the corridors.
</p>
<p><b>Room #1 Changes</b>: A &amp; B > DC 10 Perception to notice a black, glass-like stone embedded in the reliefs on the wall. It is actually a strange resin, generally worthless but worth 25gp each.
</p>
<p><b>Room #2 Changes</b>: Creatures unaligned or without a good portion to their alignment receive a -4 penalty on their Wisdom check to resist Gibbering.. and its range is doubled in the echoing corridor. The bones of several creatures and their remains. There is a serviceable suit of chainmail, but the other armors are falling apart. There is a long sword, short sword, and a scimitar (5E DMG p19-20) which have been imbued with an evil animation from the gibbering mouther. One can enter the foray each round after the mouther starts gibbering. Unless a character has a passive Perception of 14 or more, they get surprise on their first attack.
</p>
<p><b>Room #3 Changes</b>:
</p>
<p><b>Room #4 &#8211; 6 Changes</b>: NONE, except HollowBone will use these effects as weapons bagainst a pursuing party
</p>
<p><b>Room #7 Changes</b>: <b>Up ahead, strange whispers echo down the corridor.</b> The 2 creatures use the runes carved on the wall to amplify their evil whispers. It causes Confusion in a 60&#8242; to people who hear it other than themselves. Bardic Counter-charm works against this.
</p>
<p><b>Room #8 Changes</b>: Unjustly imprisoned! Promises to summon for the group a chest it has discovered on its astral travels; says the chest it cannot open but it is sure to contain something of importance &#8211; otherwise why would anyone have secreted it there.
</p>
<p><b>Room #9 Changes</b>: Masquerades as an angel. Says you can find the devil in #8. She is covered in bruises, sores, and cuts. She was part of an experiment and enchantment to siphon off her strength to fuel this complex. Mercy will cure her temporarily (food, water, and clothing), compassion will cause the chains to break &#8211; a kiss is all she needs.
</p>
<p><b>Room #10 Changes</b>: IF the party has cleared out the temple (Hollowbone must make a DC 5 Wisdom check to avoid being angry and losing his teachings) and reasons with Hollowbone, the Ki-Rin show up and release them and him and the party with their thanks. The party can then ask the Ki-Rin any question and they will try and answer. If HollowBone drops below half his HP, he loses his teachings and invokes his old master &#8211; giving up his path towards good once and for all. An Imp is sent to hail his return and assist in the fight. HollowBone gets a DC 13 Constitution check when invoking his old master to call down the effects of a Shatter Spell on the largest group of PC&#8217;s. If the PC&#8217;s have ignored or bypassed #8 and #9, these are allies he can break the chains of. He will attempt to disengage and fly to them, breaking their chains. If this happens, on the 3rd round after the first one freed, the Ki-Rin (Volo&#8217;s Guide) will appear and put down the evil creatures. They will tell Hollowbone how disappointed they ware, and how his death hurts them more than it does him. They will then turn their attention to the party and chastise them for what they have done. If only they had taken the time to talk to him.
</p>
<p><b>The Fate of Raxhanne</b>: Her remains rest here, along with a few other intrepid adventurers who have come seeking the temple&#8217;s font of wisdom or its inhabitants. There is a total of 3,411 silvers, and 1,204 gold. Minor jewelry valued at approximately 1,500. Broken and smashed equipment, armor, and weapons with no value. All that is left among the ruined books, scrolls, and clothing tatters is a figurine of stone (on a leather necklace) &#8211; a crouched warrior behind a engraved shield. It is a single use Animated Shield (anyone can use) that lasts for 1 hour; the command word is in Celestine on the bottom.
</p>
<h2><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Setup"></span>Setup<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>
<p><b>Specific to the Party on the Adventure</b>: Your days of having Spider as your quasi-patron and even friend are over for the moment. He has used you and tossed you aside like furniture. He does not return messages. In fact, he may have even left town. After retrieving the artifact for him, there appears to have been some minor altercation involving some religious sects, politicians, and himself&#8230; perhaps causing him to lay low for a while. In fact, a few unidentified individuals have come seeking his whereabouts form you&#8230; and you even had one group almost attack you. So it seems that your association is temporarily on hold.
</p>
<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Introduction"></span>Introduction<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
<p class="know bordered">Due to a local festival, your usual haunts are full up. You should have made plans, but it simply slipped your mind. Instead of your typical well-off lodgings, you find yourself at The Leaning Weasel. More of a taven than an Inn, its cheap, the beds are mostly clean, and the servants dont bite. Its a place where mercenaries are hired, and back room deals are made. Not your typical clientele or company. Sullen, you stake out one of the corners for the evening, waiting to see what entertainment will be found tonight, and waiting on the generously named stew and bread. At least the butter is good. Following the waitress is another woman, dressed in clean versions of peasants clothes. Your meal is served&#8230; under cooked again. You wait expectantly for the clean dressed woman to speak. She nervously looks around, perhaps thinking you will make the first move and after a couple awkward minutes she says her name is Anameth. She has asked for a rough group like yourselves for a job of finding a friend of hers who has gone missing. Itheena, the waitress recommended you, because she said &#8220;no one here is up to the task, sober. Theres some new group though &#8211; maybe they are not incompetent.&#8221; And so i fond myself here, beseeching you to aid me in finding my best friend Marin. Will you help me?
</p>
<p>Anameth Gunlane is a young Lady of Portent Downs; she foolishly wears her signet ring, even clothed as she is. She comes to the party seeking to find her handmaiden and friend &#8211; Marin &#8211; which she believes has been kidnapped. She offers 1000 gold to find her, and patronage the entire way (see Negotiating PAtronage). Last Seen on the docks in the company of Hemal Wilst &#8211; a locally known pimp, drug dealer, and all around scum bag.
</p>
<p><b>House Gunlane</b>: Known for its economic interest in silks, dyes, shipping, swinneries, and tapestries. Few practicing MAtrilineal descent.

<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Background_Setup"></span>Background Setup<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
<p>Her brother Gerrard has had her handmaiden kidnapped and sold into slavery because she has been putting &#8220;silly notions&#8221; in Anameth&#8217;s head. Gerrard had an idea to sell her into slavery (whispers in his dream &#8211; he wont be killing her, it will stabilize the situation, good for family, whatever it takes; in reality the mad, aging fallen angel is trying to expand influence and spread evil from Willait). Anameth is the elder sibling of a family which practices the old ways of matrileneal preference in inheritance. Anameth once trusted her brother, and now believes the worst of him &#8211; rightfully so. She should fear for her own life, but is concentrated on her best friend.</p>

Slight Roleplaying: You do not have to be in-character, but situational bonuses will be granted if you do roleplay.<br />

The crystal shards work as a unit &#8211; if one breaks, the entire necklace is useless. When the wearer takes them off, they can sing at a certain frequency, pitch and tone to enact their magic. The crystals vibrate when they are working. Each effect can only be done 1/long rest.<br />
> All functions are at the minimum level to enact for the spell, unless the wearer is a bard and their bard spell level is higher &#8211; it then uses that level. A bard is considered 2 levels higher for their song of rest. The singing to enact is done as an Action and takes 1 round to work.<br />
1) The necklace is placed on the chest of the target and the wearer sings: The target is affected as if by a Lesser Restoration and Feign Death if so desired. </p>
<p>2) The necklace is placed on the head of the target and the wearer sings: The target continues to hear the song in their head for the next hour &#8211; during which time they are resistant to psychic damage, immune to Charmed and Frightened and it negates 1 level of Exhaustion during that time. </p>
<p>3) The necklace is held above the wearer and the wearer sings: combines the Light cantrip and Healing Word; if cast at second level or higher then each D4 may be placed on different targets. </p>
<p>Requires Attunement; it takes a bonus action to take the necklace off or on. The wearer must sing for an hour 1/short rest and at least 3 times per long rest  to re-energize the necklace. </p>
