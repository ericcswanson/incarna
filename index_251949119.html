      <div class="panel-body"><p>Incarna is a system of gritty realism. The mechanics promote deadly combat, intense action, and the intended focus is on <span id="advMenu" class="lnk" onclick="$('#dialogMenu').toggle();">story</span>, skills, and a mixture of combat and puzzle/problem solving. Some rules herein may reference concepts unique to Incarna - you will need access to the online rule set for specific details. Most GM’s can assess the Incarna specific elements in context and leave or remove them as needed. <i>Where you see this: <i class="fa fa-plug"></i>, the GM must "plug-in" their own materials to round out the adventure in their campaign.</i> It is strong recommended something such as a <a href="host/kelly-berger/gaming-contract/index.html">Gaming Contract</a> be put into place.</p>
<ul>
<li>In DnD terms, Incarna uses 8 hours rest as a short rest, and 1 week rest as a long rest.</li>
<li>Incarna uses Sanity; this is an optional element of DnD and should be used.</li>
<li>Incarna uses a form of life-power called Essence; (Charisma+Sanity)/2 = the starting “well” of Essence (which returns at 1/Short Rest if used to trigger effects). Items with Essence themselves require attunement before their benefits can be gained.</li>

He has since looked into it, discovered a terrible force in the area, and is afraid for his life to look any closer at what is going on.

Temiri has been studying the area and learning to draw upon its power to enhance his own, he is familiar with the locale and the myths of it going back to the time when the Pine Tribes ruled the land. Their warriors and shaman still make secret pilgrimages to it to this day.
</p>
<div class="bordered know">As night falls, a man comes to see you. He introduces himself as Temiri. He says he is from an academic brotherhood in South Drift, and believes that the party has killed the infamous ork champion named Coreblack. &#8220;Coreblack is a menacing power in the north. He has rallied hundreds of Orrish to his banner time and again, invading, putting villages to the torch, and causing the rise of heros and men to stop him &#8211; but has never himself been caught in a dozen years.He has never come this far south.&#8221; He shakes his head and frowns&#8230; and he tells you  there has been a few disappearances lately around the area, and the bodies of those who vanished &#8211; a tradesman, a local politician, watchman, copper, and others were all part of the skeletons and zombies he had with him. One of Coreblack’s signatures is to attack targets using the undead animations of their families and friends. The town had his order review the found possessions the party brought back from the attackers and trinkets and jewelry all identified the victims.
</div>
<p>Temiri wishes to buy the party a round in thanks for returning the few possessions, and for putting their spirits to final rest. After an hour of small talk, he will turn to one of the party members and say. </p>
<h4><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Temiri_the_Diviner-2"></span>Temiri the Diviner<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h4>
<p>Temiri (of <a href="verse/set/steel-realms/occult/house-mataff/index.html">House Mataff</a>) believes himself was the target of a round-up, but he has able to draw on his occult powers and avoid them by hiding ahead of time. He has since looked into it, discovered a terrible force in the area, and is afraid for his life to look any closer at what is going on. The very thing that has drawn him to the area – The Emerald Falls – now is likely to hold an evil more powerful than a dozen mages. Temiri has been studying the area and learning to draw upon its power to enhance his own, he is familiar with the locale and the myths of it going back to the time when the Pine Tribes ruled the land. He believes their warriors and shaman still make secret pilgrimages to it to this day.
</p>
<div class="bordered know-more">Temiri says that he has sensed a god-like power with his meager powers. It is the time of the Green Falls – Twice per year (spring and fall) the falls at Calibri Lake turn green. Normally he uses this time to enhance his own powers, but he says to stay away. There is a power tapping into the falls, and the barriers between worlds is lowering and that dangerous things will prowl the lands nearby. &#8220;Already they have come for me – but my own powers warned me. They ransacked my home, and fortunately did not possess the powers to perceive me, hidden as i was by my own magics. Even your own intuition is telling you to stay away &#8211; I suggest perhaps we should law low until the Time of The Interloper is past.&#8221; He says this, but its clear he may not believe it – he is fearful.
</div>
<p><P>He will let that sink in and let the party talk and ask questions. If the party decides to lay low as he says, he will excuse himself to leave and get supplies and leave the area. If the party indicates they will stay and fight whatever is coming, he will be visibly relieved. </p>
<div class="bordered know-more">&#8220;I think something is happening and no one is likely to believe me who has not seen these forces at work already. It&#8217;s no coincidence that the cosmos has sent you this way. I have heard of your group and your reputation, and i would call upon your sense of honor to assist me in uncovering what Coreblack was doing here. What say you &#8211; can I count on your aid?&#8221;</div>
<div><i class="fa fa-eye"></i> <b>Insight DC 15</b></p>
<p class="panel panel-default know-more">If Coreblack was this far south it was for nefarious reasons. He attacked you in the dim light of the evening &#8211; but still light. Whatever he hoped to accomplish, he was counting on catching you by surprise and it must have hurt him greatly to operate in partial sunlight. If he had time to amass animations, he’s been here for a while &#8211; this was planned, not coincidence. </p>
</div>
<div class="bordered know-more"> &#8220;I thank you greatly. I will not disappoint you. I have arranged to legitimize our efforts on the morrow. Please meet me an hour after sunrise at the postal depot. Now, you must be tired &#8211; I do not wish to presume more upon you this night. You must get your rest for tomorrow you may need all your strength. I bid you goodnight!&#8221; And with a flourish, he moves out into the cold night. </div>
<ul>
<li>Tracking him / What can the party learn about Temiri -Following him, he visits a tea shop, and picks up some parchment and ink and spends the rest of the evening packing. The party will waste a night and learn nothing about him.</li>
<li>Asking around, they learn he is indeed a Diviner of the House Mataff of South Drift &#8211; a small order of mages which pursue academic ends; recovery of lost artifacts and knowledge from the ancient northern kingdom. </li>
<li>An old hag in grey is following him! She looks into his window &#8211; without care who sees her. Just when the party is going to apprehend, a massive flurry of snow and ice obscure her and she is gone. </li>
</ul>
<p>Either that night, if they disturb him, or the next day if they mention to old hag, he will say:</p>
<div class="bordered know-more-yet">&#8220;I have seen her too &#8211; even in my dreams. She haunts me&#8230; the signs have been odd to say the least. Where the old woman is concerned, my powers have been weakening recently. I can learn nothing about her save these things: She is of north blood and She does not seem intent on harming him
</div>
<p>On a Persuasion DC 10 check, he says he believes her to be related to the ancient Witch-Seers of Volgada. </p>
<p>On a Persuade DC 13 check, he says he dreams of her. The woman in grey warned him not to join the foraging before the storm &#8211; it would have been him and not the party into the area where Coreblack was waiting. He thinks, maybe, Coreblack was trying to ambush him. </p>
<p>DC 10 Insight = remember Coreblack did seem surprised at the party number, perhaps he was not expecting so many</p>

<div class="bordered know">The next morning, you meet Temiri as planned. At the postal depot, the local Sheriff deputizes him and he swears you in as his posse. &#8220;Now whatever we do, we do for righteousness.&#8221; The Sheriff only looks grimly on, and Temiri outlines his plan of tracking down anyone who was helping Coreblack. Temiri thinks it&#8217;s important to go back to the place where Coreblack tried to ambush the party and maybe he as a diviner can pick up his trail from there. This far from his normal grounds, Temiri figures he must have had a lair of some sorts. &#8220;A powerful black knight like him does not get this far without a base of operations.&#8221;</div>
<p>Divining powers allow him to follow the party to the bottom of the ridge and east. North then into the snow, and out onto the plain. The party will say that the area looks familiar at some point &#8211; exactly where Temiri believed they were.
</p>
<div class="bordered know-more-yet">Recent snows have covered the scene of any battle. The cold embrace of the coming winter has eradicated all else. But Temiri scratches through the snow into the hard ground, laying the framework of his spell. He begins the ritual and his eyes widen, as if he is seeing something only he can. The he points, and slowly turns in a circle until he stops. He follows the way he pointed. There is no path, but he seems to know his way. </div>
<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Coreblacks_Camp"></span>Coreblacks Camp<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
<p>Coreblack’s camp seems to be a jagged gash cut into a low rise facing north. Its nearly impossible to spot, and out of the way of wind. It has fresh water &#8211; a small drip inside and the cave fits a couple dozen. The path leads further north under cave lip. There are 4 goblins guarding it with a crossbow each and 6 bolts a piece (potent weapons for orrish!) and 2 spiders of Go-Zen!! Crossbow (poison; DC 12 Con)</p>
<p>In the camp there is evidence that instructions written in Galdnorian were being read by Coreblack. The area that the party was ambushed in was marked in a crude map in a locked chest (buried in rubble &#8211; a key is buried under s smaller pile of rubble) &#8211; ridge line is laid out a building marked at the base in trader town with symbol of Sun Stealer Clergy (Religion 15). Orrish word for “contact” is carved on an animal skin map &#8211; it was attempted to burn but did not in the fire. Temri says he has a odd feeling about this.

The ghoul dug its way straight up and escaped into the night &#8211; now it prowls and killed every full moon &#8211; waiting for the corrupted moon when it will kill on a scale the boggles the mind. It got away from its would be master, and avoids him thinking it will be shackled again. It has since dug its way in and out of the ice around Doinesh, exposing more books. William thinks its enough forbidden knowledge to make him a lord of the north. He has killed dozens, poisoned more and brough small miseries for decades. He is waiting for a sign.

<div class="know bordered">That night, a celebratory late night sweet meat snack is delivered right before bed. After the server leave, you find a clear piece of crystal with some sort of figure carved into it next to the candle on your table when you retire to your room. [It’s a hologram] Some sort of real life size man with vinyl-like black skin, shiny and slick, dressed in blue, gold, black &#038; white appears a few feet away. His arms are crossed in his typical Sun Stealer pose of a disapproving look. “I never forget to pay my debts. You interfered with what should have been an event to shape history in my name for centuries to come, instead causing it to have little impact. To repay you, I made sure you were in the right place, at the right time to do the same. Either way rebellion will come to the north &#8211; as a result of the Black Gorgon getting his way, or through the forbidden alliance the northerners make. But you will be known to be at the center of it now and not to be trusted &#8211; you will alienate one side and i will make sure the other never trusts you either. Thank you for your assistance &#8211; you have redeemed yourself. But no one will believe we are allies for long, so I want you to know, when you feel that blade slice across your throat at night, it was me who gave cause. Look!” He stretches out a rough piece of parchment, on it, written in blood in Orrish it lists the blessings of 10 sacrificed souls and 10,000 silver crowns in ancient jewelry for the head of my enemies (he lists them whole). The figure throws back its head and howls in laughter. He smiles with a sharp toothed grin &#8211; “Enjoy your last few days, fools!”

<p><b>Advice</b> > Temiri says that he has sensed a god-like power with his meager powers. It is the time of the Green Falls &#8211; 3/year the falls at Calibri Lake turn green. Normally he uses this time to enhance his own powers, but he says to stay away. There is a power tapping into the falls, and the barriers between worlds is lowering and that dangerous things will prowl the lands nearby. <q>Already they have come for me &#8211; but my own powers warned me. They ransacked my home, and fortunately did not possess the powers to perceive me, hidden as i was by my own magics. Your own intuition is telling you to stay away.</q> He says this, but its clear he may not believe it &#8211; he is fearful.

<p>Three times a year, under the full moon, the mists and froth of the falls turns green &#8211; opening a gate to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(Dungeons_%26_Dragons)">The Feywild</a>. During this time, it enhances the senses and power of divination&#8217;s &#8211; it allows the senses the stretch farther, and be more accurate for those who wish to cover themselves with the mist of the falls.

<div>Conversation between <b>S</b> (Sun Stealer) and <b>A</b> (Asmodeus)
</p>
<p><b>S</b>: <q>You promised meeee&#8230;</q>
</p>
<p><b>A</b>: <q>You are barely here&#8230; there is nothing to be done. I sought advice&#8230; from places even I am uncomfortable looking in.</q>
</p>
<p><b>S</b>: <q>You were paid handsomely! Blood and souls&#8230;</q>
</p>
<p><b>A</b>: <q>Worn souls&#8230; bitter blood. And mostly failure. </q>
</p>
<p><b>S</b>: <q>Blood and souls nonetheless.</q>
</p>
<p><b>A</b>: <q>I am here. Your worshipers brought me &#8211; mostly with their own lives, leaving us less than protected I might add. What other business do we have? Tell me i was not summoned forth to merely answer a question you already knew. </q>
</p>
<p><b>S</b>: <q>The Cowled One&#8230; plans within plans. They plot and we dance &#8211; I sense a growing storm.</q>
</p>
<p><b>A</b>: <q>What care I? Its reach is contained &#8211; mostly here now. I dare not advance my own forces of hell here &#8211; unless you seek to partner and usurp the power of your brother? No&#8230; I thought not. The power of your siblings is unmatched here. Even I cannot stand under the light of The Interloper and hope to conquer any lands here. Your power is supreme here yet &#8211; you know this.</q>
</p>
<p><b>S</b>: <q>Like a beast&#8217;s power in a cage. Lend me but a small force of your host. I will finally succeed.</q>
</p>
<p><b>A</b>: <q>For what gain!? The carcass of a barren world? Your birth pangs saw the death of gods and world alike &#8211; I know where your path leads. I enjoy the physical world! Its carnal pleasures and wickedness. You would cut even the air if it bled. There would be nothing left for me to enjoy should I do this. Your nihilism has nothing to offer one such as I.</q>
</p>
<p><b>S</b>: <q>I could kill you.</q>
</p>
<p><b>A</b>: <q>Alas&#8230; no. Try you may, but our powers are equally matched within this chamber &#8211; look around, your followers sacrifice saw to that. Not that you care&#8230; and it was enjoyable to listen to their screams. </q>
</p>
<p><b>S</b>: <q>Arrrgh! Lend me some agents, just a few to wreak the havoc you know I could. It is both of our plans The Cowled One will thwart.</q>
</p>
<p><b>A</b>: <q>Patience. Our plan will benefit us both if you let it.</q>
</p>
<p><b>S</b>: <q>No! I will not be thwarted! We will not be thwarted!</q>
</p>
<p><b>A</b>: <q>I cannot see. She cannot see where he is concerned. I am as blind as you. Patience is all that is left.</q>
</p>
<p><b>S</b>: <q>Millennium I have schemed. Centuries have I waited for this moment.</q>
</p>
<p><b>A</b>: <q>And yet&#8230; patience is all we have. I have. You&#8230; have your hate.</q>
</p>
<p><b>S</b>: <q>It is your plans too that will falter! You are a fool to have no fear or desire to stop that&#8230; thing!</q>
</p>
<p><b>A</b>: <q>Should I? What is to gain? He has been silent for so long. If it casts its gaze our way we will be disturbed &#8211; such is the way of things. Uncertainty and fear will be the goblet we drink from should we choose to continue &#8211; even more than the heady brew you normally drink. </q>
</p>
<p><b>S</b>: <q>It need not be like this. Others nearly conquered that one several times. His shadow is caged and worthless. Bound to the Thrice Shackled Prince &#8211; not even I could wrest it from him, though he be&#8230; dead, in his place of power. </q>
</p>
<p><b>A</b>: <q>And look what it cost him.</q>
</p>
<p><b>S</b>: <q>Our gain.</q>
</p>
<p><b>A</b>: <q>Your gain.</q>
</p>
<p><b>S</b>: <q>Fuck you! How can it move with such impunity? Where does the power come from!? I can advance your cause&#8230;*</q>
</p>
<p><b>A</b>: <q>My cause! You talk of causes, you vile brute. Perhaps I should find the shade of your mother to fuck while we wait for you to contribute to my cause. You are a shallow creature of bad habits and devoid of intellect &#8211; even yet without a soul. I can make no claim to cause here. You and yours have this place of power locked. My cause is meaningless! I find this conversation&#8230; odious. Farewell beast &#8211; I am sure we will meet soon again &#8211; too soon for my tastes.</q>
</p>
<p><b>S</b>: <q>I&#8217;ll&#8230;*</q>
</p>
<p><b>A</b>: <q>Shit! Something is happening! I sense&#8230; *</q> The dark form twists and writhes and vanishes in a puff of foul smelling smoke.
