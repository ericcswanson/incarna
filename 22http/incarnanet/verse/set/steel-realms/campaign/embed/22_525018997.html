It’s power was wielded by the Nurth shaman Irthgon in the Battle of Three Deep, where its presence was made known again by its signature sickly green flames. It was a legendary battle in which the three tunnels leading into the Deep Nest were defended by 3 ranks of 21 Ducateon matrons &#8211; a desperate battle fought for hours in which the matrons sang a dolorous dirge that was said to bring the spirits of their dead back to fight (something horrific to the Ducateon normally and never done since). In the end, only shadows remained &#8211; the entire force of a thousand Nurth were dead and all the Ducateon lifeless. The Ducateon banished the shades of the fallen though the artifact could not be destroyed, and corrupted many Ducateon who tried. These had to be hunted and put down by their own people. It was taken to the Spire Tooth Caverns &#8211; where Ducateon race-traitors are known to be taken and purged of their unmutual thoughts against The Collective (though none but a few Ducateon know the location itself). </li>

From there, a massive storm tore northward, passing most of the south. The storm was so vialent that it shook the ground and changed the air days ahead of its path. The storm raged up the Storm Coast, breaking against the Umbakain peninsula and tearing loose towns and villages  from their very foundations. Raging out to see, the storm once again came inland in Blackwater Bay and broke into several lightning storms which took centuries to finally die out. In the mean time, the Curtian of Night was broken in several places and bulged in others. The eastern frontier raged in warfare for a centruy as whatever the storm&#8217;s influence continued to fluctuate the borders of the Darklands. The final fate<br />
of the power that loosed the storms in unknown. It is whispered that it was adventurer&#8217;s greed and curiosity<br />
that awoke an ancient power in the south, underneath the Hobnail Plateau. <i>Over its course,<br />

The Skraelings were thought to have been destroyed in the genocidal madness which swept northwards, into the daylight. Many of the best knights of the High King died stemming the tide of darkness. The fire of the woods was turned to against the shadow, and made as bright as day. The lands were given over to the druids, which sacrificed the forest, knowing lost already and wanting to rid what was left of the taint. They were able to rapidly re-grow the once proud forest, although hundreds of years will be required to return it to the lushness it once was. The Order of Darvos erected a great wall of brambles, which re-grows itself when destroyed. This wall is known as Toolins Den, named after the Skraeling hero of the Battle of Autumn Valley.

<ul>
<li>Rise of the mercenary culture in the south</li>
<li id="offrec">CY 5743; The Steel League of the South and the High King, with the powers of the Church of Aerna and the Green Church found the Office of Reclamation. An entire order dedicated to restoring the blasted lands of the south.
</li>
<li>CY 5685; The High King commissions the ranger brotherhood of the Desert Lions to explore and watch the south.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>CY 5413:</b> Balletogue breaks Away &#8211; Carlion Balletogue conquers the local lords in a ten year bloody<br />
campaign. He kills all claimants by blood and ends the blood line of many southern noble families. The<br />
High King refuses to recognize this independence, but it is so far from the troubles and so secure that<br />
the effort to convince the King of Balletogue otherwise is not worth the effort. The border powers of the<br />
south are afraid of the power their new neighbor wields.
</p>
<p><b>CY 5400:</b> Crusade of Welences &#8211; The remnants of family Fadhamir, one of the last imperial southern<br />
lines carries the fires of light to reclaim the Broken Lands. On the far edges of known lands, the<br />
bloodline is ended and a horde of dark spawn led by twin priests is thrown down. Slowly, the re-conquered<br />
lands are given back to the desolation.
</p>
<p><b>CY 5354:</b> Rise of the Merchant Cities – The coordinated effort to supply the south during the<br />
first Nakran War gives rise to the official formation of the Merchant City &#8220;League&#8221; of the South and North (constituted from the once conquered allies of the Salvin Warlords in the north).
</p>
<p><b>CY 5347-5350:</b> The First Nakrian Wars &#8211; Beryl raises largest call to arms in hundreds of years<br />
as a Nakrian army sweeps north.
</p>
<p><b>CY 5348:</b> Steel League of the South formed. Border nations and those small independent territories north of the abyssal band together for economic and defense benefits around Waerl bay.
</p>
<p><b>CY 5288:</b> The fall of the Sea-Kings &#8211; All the coastal settlements and a large portion of the Sea Bourne isles in the homeland are sunk beneath the waves. Mighty magics are employed to save the rich and opulent cities, but most fail and the greatest magi and priests of the Sea-King Empire are wiped out as a result of The Sundering’s effects. Once virtually immune to the wrath of the dragons, all large sea going vessels were purposely attacked. Dragon attacks Kraken and the mighty krakens, kings of the sea, are thrown down beneath the waves. The last of the Sea-King settlements outside of Gwinnish cities is sacked in 5288.
</p>
<p><b>CY 5102:</b> The re-founding of Beryl as an independent city.

<li>CY 4649 &#8211; 4673; The Broken North &#8211; war rages in the far north as the Sea-Kings try and colonize far inland.

With each uprising, the High King must divert forces from the battle with the Orrish. Finally, When the Teilhard house of the Duchy of Umbak declares itself a sovereign kingdom, the High King negotiates a peace – allowing the kingdom to continue, but requiring the King of Umbak to be his enforcement arm in the west – especially against the terrifying and strange power of the Sea Kings.

Cuural, a fey elf united the tribes of the T&#8217;Yendi hill peoples and Grollen against Gladnor. Borrenhal had learned warfare in the court of the king at Gladnor, in Oerdney, as a hostage of the High King. Once old enough his father put him in charge of the north reaches of the kingdom. It is said that he slew the Black Hawk by treachery, that it was in his blood. For next, he slew his brothers, one after another. He usurped Black Hawk&#8217;s place at the front of the T&#8217;Yendi peoples and marched against his own brothers and father, killing each in battle until the kingdom was finally his. But he did not stop. In league with dark magics, he spread his rule by torch and sword. He conquered all lands north of the Grey woods except Umbak. He turned his war into the darklands, and human darkness of the soul eclipsed the darkness of night. All things were turned to war, until the day he died and his heir took control. He proclaimed himself the One-King, above all others. Only Umbak held out against him, allying herself with the exiled forces of Gladnor, the faeries of the north and even the Ducateon, for his Shadow Spawn had infiltrated several holts, poisoning the colonies and warping their dead spirits. The madness of pride and possession ran into the bloodline of Dundaria and the line of One-Kings reigned for 60 years over 5 kings – all wed to the same woman &#8211; until Aechus of Umbak drove all the way to the sacred mountain of the Hael Ruthi, leading a force through the north which caught the undying witch-mate of the line of kings unawares. It is said that her bones were scattered across the realms of man and beast, and even the dark lands so that her spirit could not return.</li>
<li id="oldven">CY 2904 &#8211; Fiefdom of Ven-Bra-Yur; the Sea Kings finally conquer the lands of most of modern day Dunstrand, annihilating the current inhabitants except those of the Salvin Warlords (south of the Beyne River). The clans of this merciless savage culture is made allies and serve as a buffer to the north heartlands.</li>
<li>CY 2866-2968; Kraken’s War &#8211; The Sea-Kings control and dominate the water ways – up rivers and at sea. They have strange vessels and creatures in service to them and terrorize the lands of men, colonizing the coastal lands and all island territories. </li>

        to cross the Belnok Mountains in the north and reclaim their lost lands, sacking the new Ducateon Holts on<br />
        their way. The Orrish push their way south into what becomes Dar-Hashuk. Men move west into lands set<br />
        aside as sanctuary. The Orrish somehow are able to assassinate every leader or disrupt every council<br />
        meeting the elect a new High Councilor.

        the magi and priests of men combine their forces, sending out a call for aid into the gulfs – this time<br />
        with the aid of the green church. From the heart of the sun comes a message – ‘The Light is Coming to<br />
        Banish the Dark’. On the first of the new year, as the sun rises, its shrugs off a piece of itself, a<br />

<p><b>CY 30-343;</b> The First Fellowship was lead by men. Many scholars speculate that this great pouring<br />
        forth of life is what awakened the land and brought the races to fight as one. In a time when all that was<br />
        left was primitive and crude, when nothing was left of the politics and feuds, the races came together to<br />
        fight in a lowland plain named Chur-Eda. The exact location is lost to history, although it is thought to<br />
        be south of the Valley of Sighs. After this battle the first Fellowship Council was called, a crude<br />
        governing body made of members of each race – with a High Councilor reigning above all. Together, every<br />
        family or every race organized and fought the Orrish. The gods of darkness were weak and in the age of the<br />
        First Fellowship, the northlands, where Dundaria would come to stand, were cleansed of their presence. All<br />
        the remaining forces were pushed into the ancient land of Orishai. The Fellowship comes to an end on the<br />
        Eve of Baal (the summer solstice) when the High Councilor of the Fellowship is killed while touring the<br />
        frontier of an Orishai quiet for a dozen years. In an attempt to show how safe it was, he exposed himself<br />
        to danger. An army of Orrish overwhelmed the frontier fort and the age of victory and innocence died in a<br />
        single night.

<p><b>Blood of the Earth:</b> (CY 29) Slowly, the chains binding the dark gods unraveled. A great wound<br />
        opened up and disgorged its contents. Right away the worshipers of nature knew what had been done, for<br />
        each of them was marked with a wound which would not heal, not even unto death. Their mother had been<br />
        heart and so the cry went out once again. The war-banners of the Orrish were raised once again, this time<br />
        dipped in the blood of their gods. War had come to the survivors of Saemon again.

<p><b><a href="../../../../../../../verse/set/steel-realms/divine/grey/ezrilus/tear-gift/index.html" title="" target="_self" rel="" class="">Tear Gift of Ezrilus</a>:</b> (CY 15) With the mass devastation and untold number of death, the ebb and flow<br />
        of life was at an all-time low. Ghosts haunted everyone’s dreams, children were dying in the womb, and<br />
        fear still walked the land while the remaining Orrish and their allies began to flourish. Into this<br />
        situation stepped Ezrilus, who cried when she saw for herself the loss of life and hope. Her tears mixed<br />
        with the waters of the world, and so unto every race were given the possibility of breeding with another.<br />
        The chains on death had been released and hope sprung anew.
        </p>
<p><b>Calling of the Gray Gods:</b> (CY 14) With the power of the Green Host and Celestials spent, the<br />
        races looked to the skies for aid. Unable to contact their olden gods for aid, they sought new ones. Magi<br />
        gathered and began to record the knowledge of their craft, for fear it be forgotten. They too conjured and<br />
        called, seeing what powers they may contact. This all reached a distant place wherein dwelled the Wyld<br />
        Gods – gods of power and energy, untamed forces. They gave the magi the knowledge of how to safely<br />
        activate the gate in the valley again. The priest of the olden gods divided along the lines of the new<br />
        ones, and to each was born a clergy that would call their god across the gulfs, through the gate that the<br />
        magi would activate once again. And so they traveled, protected by an army of men, into the Valley of<br />
        Sighs and returned with the new gods – the Gray Gods of Elancil, Ezrilus, Mizras, and Malek.

<p><b>The Scattering:</b> (CY 7-8) The gods of darkness were cast down. The deaths exceeded one million all<br />
        total, and no clear victory was achieved by any side. Towards the end, fetid winds began to blow the smell<br />
        of death for days in every direction. It is said the sacrifice of life was so great, that some sort of<br />
        magical effect was spawned. The earth belched forth nightmare creatures continuously, until both sides<br />
        were forced to retreat. The valley has been shunned by most ever since. Winds carry the clash of arms<br />
        still, and the battle horns and drums echo in the distance. The dying sighs of a million living beings are<br />
        still heard, miles outside the valley. The voices of the dying cry for mercy and those in misery beg for<br />
        death. The sane do not stay so for long in the valley. Strange creatures are said to prowl its confines,<br />
        sometimes breaking free of whatever barrier normally confines them to ravage nearby lands, paying no heed<br />
        whether they be Orrish lands or other.
        </p>
<ul>
<li>Celestial Forbiddance: CY 8, The tribes of <a href="../../../../../../../set/srlm/places/nakria/index.html">Nakria</a> returned to their far-away land to the south. The<br />
        Celestial’s walk amongst the blood of Saemon and tell every leader amongst them that the south is<br />
        forbidden – the price of their assistance is to forever secure the lands south of the Raj (then called The<br />
        Brine Sea).</li>
<li>Men settled the east, north and south of the valley. </li>
<li>Orrish and their allies fled to the north to contest with men and north-east – a place they settled<br />
        called Orishai.</li>
<li>The faeries fled to the forests of the west, to blot out the memories of death from their collective<br />
        memory</li>
<li>The Ducateon went to found homes in the Tolkisson Range.</li>
<li>Others found places near to the east and lands of men.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Battle of Helca&#8217;s Children:</b> (CY 6) The gods of darkness walked the land in physical form, casting<br />
        down the sun and turning all to ash in their crusade. Their followers continued to pour through the gateway,<br />
        killing everything in their path. When all seemed lost, the Green Host finally arrived to aid the Blood of<br />
        Saemon. Faerie, Ducateon, Human, Grollen and all other races united under the banner of their new adopted<br />
        home to save it from destruction. The beasts and plants walked in these days, and overwhelmed the gods of<br />
        darkness with their natural powers of life. They closed forever the doorway to another place, and cut off<br />
        any further augmentation of the Orrish host. The battle raged again for a full cycle of the moon. The<br />
        Orrish host did not sit idle and came to the aid of their masters. Millions of beings fought and died in one<br />
        place.
        </p>
<p>The Celestials unite and bring their tribes and tore into the Orrish host, even into the peoples of<br />
        what they saw as invaders. The Celestial Host arrival throws everything into disarray – somehow neither<br />
        side was able to detect their presence.
        </p>
<p><b>The Awakening of the Green Host:</b> (Cy 5) Deep in the forest of the Fertile Crescent slept an ancient force, one that had slept through the eons of humanities rise and struggles. With the coming of<br />
        the Blood of Seamon, this force arose to do battle with an energy that had already begun to corrupt and<br />
        pollute the planet &#8211; the influence of the Unholy Trio. The Green Lady, Lady Gaia, Mother Gaia stirred and from her womb came the first giants to walk upon Helca. The giants came from the earth, air, fire and water. The <a href="../../../../../../../verse/set/steel-realms/creatures/beastiary/giants/index.html">Awakening of the Giants</a> brought all types of giants, spontaneously created to do battle. The lord of beasts gained consciousness and began<br />
        the slow walk north and east, gathering unto him all the &#8216;great&#8217; natural powers that answered his call. To<br />
        each who answered the call for aid in the coming battle, he breathed life into one and created the great<br />
        archetypes who are worshiped to this day. They in turn gathered their own kind unto them, combined with the Celestials and their animal and Merovin host, and marched over<br />
        the mountains and into battle with the Orrish hosts and those of the Blood of Saemon. Word went out, from<br />
        those who had venerated the natural presence of the homelands, that the earth was alive here, just as it<br />
        had been there.
        </p>
<p><b>Arrival of The Interloper:</b> (CY 4) After years of war and strife, fire and blood, a new moon<br />
        appeared in the sky – a moon simply called ‘the interloper’. It was a black chunk of basalt rock, ripped<br />
        from the home-place of the Unholy Trio. Upon this the Unholy Trio was said to make their home. The trio<br />
        soon stepped down from their watch and entered the battle on the side of their servants, the Orrish, the<br />
        Trolls, and misguided Ko-bolds. A dark shadow was cast upon Helca and the gods of darkness began their<br />
        destruction.
        </p>
<p><b>The Confrontation:</b> (CY 3) Events leading up to this great battle, referred to as &#8216;The Confrontation&#8217;,<br />
        are unclear. However, it was not more than two or three years after the Great Crossing. The Orrish and<br />
        their allies, once driven back by and prohibited from following, found a way through the passage used by<br />
        the Blood of Saemon. A massive army, ready for battle and carrying the standards of the Unholy Trio moved<br />
        into the valley. It trod directly amidst the survivors trying to rebuild their cultures. So horrible and<br />
        terrifying was this battle, that its effects are still observed today. The forces of light and darkness<br />
        fought a great pitched battle in this valley. It is said to have raged for a full cycle of the moon nonstop.
