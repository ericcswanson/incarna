Basics of Growing Up: [Clan Stonefell of the Stormfront Fastness] Clan Stonefell, in the Hareaver Clashes, fought against the pirate and scavenger forces that came ashore. It seems like the humans had a short memory of how the dwarves of that region had gained their name. They were reminded when their forces were crushed under an avalanche started by the dwarves. Duck&#8217;s blood lust aberration became apparent then &#8211; he gleefully slew the survivors. He fought for years against the Hareaver&#8217;s of Scrape, accumulating many kills and became decent warrior. His recklessness even got him onto a reaver boat in the tidal shoals during a counter attack &#8211; he was surrounded by water before he knew what was going on. His bloodlust eventually caused him to be forced from his clan, and seek employment in the Merchant Cities of the South.<br />

Basics of Growing Up: [Merchant Cities of the South] Meb was part of a celestial host of those following Aerna. She was part of a troup that performed for the goddess, in the merchant cities, at festivals. Meb rose up when his priesthood capitulated at Waeverly Rock in the Crou Invasion of the Pale Plains. Those who surrendered were tortured and the flock flayed alive by the mad priest Delcrou. Meb refused to surrender, instead becoming angry and turning against the wishes of the temple. Meb slew several of the followers as they cowered in fear &#8211; waiting for their turn to be sacrificed by the mad priest. Meb flew away, towards the hills and crashed into the mountainside when his wings failed. He awoke bereft of grace. Meb gave up on his ideals and became confidence man &#8211; scamming many unworthy souls. He adopted the faith of the fire goddess on a whim &#8211; as a means of trying to feel the grace he felt once again (yet making it difficult &#8211; self sabotaging almost for a goddess so far distant from her core base of believers). Eventually he fell in as a sell-sword, and began to convert many of the band to Merkaine&#8217;s ways &#8211; &#8220;The Cleansing Flame&#8221; being a natural ideology for those who burn, pillage and loot.<br />

He likes to play simple, practical jokes and loves to let children crawl all over him and tickle them. Of course, no one lets their kids within 10 miles if they can help it. Its theorized that the blow to the head he took in the Montaurn Campaign when he first joined somehow altered him.

&#8211; You gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls you make with a spear.<br />
&#8211; When you use a spear, its damage die changes from a d6 to a d8, and from a d8 to a d10 when wielded with two hands. (This benefit has no effect if another feature has already improved the weapon’s die.)<br />

If that creature moves within your spear’s reach on its next turn, you can make a melee attack against it with your spear as a reaction. If the attack hits, the target takes an extra 1d8 piercing damage, or an extra 1d10 piercing damage if you wield the spear with two hands. You can’t use this ability if the creature used the Disengage action before moving.<br />
&#8211; As a bonus action on your turn, you can increase your reach with a spear by 5 feet for the rest of your turn.</p>

You gain proficiency in the Intimidation skill. If you are already proficient in the skill, you add double your proficiency bonus to checks you make with it. When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can replace one attack with an attempt to demoralize one humanoid you can see within 30 feet of you that can see and hear you. Make a Charisma (Intimidation) check contested by the target&#8217;s Wisdom (Insight) check. If your check succeeds, the target is frightened until the end of your next turn. If your check fails, the target can&#8217;t be frightened by you in this way for 1 hour.<br />

Background: MERCHANT (Proficiency = Insight, Persuasion, Languages +2)<br />
Basics of Growing Up: [Nakrian] Worked as a merchant&#8217;s assistant in Beryl until the merchant was killed in Scrape on a mission there and he was forced to hide and flee in the city. Umbakian privateers intercepted his master Taramucci&#8217;s which was taking a contract and survey maps to Beryl, picking up from Gwinn via pirates in Scrape. He was taken on the docks after 2 weeks by a press gang and would have been a galley slave except he could read and write, and speak multiple languages. He served on the pirate vessel for 2 years; He bought his way off it in Poeltiz of the Merchant Cities with nothing to show but his freedom. He came upon two drunks being beaten and robbed on the docks and helped them fend off their attackers. These were 2 of the Black Hounds (the 2 are now dead); Despite his empty hands he was given a chance to prove himself &#8211; all he asked for was a shield and club and he beat back 2 attackers at once. That gained him a place with the Black Hounds. His needs are simple and he was happy to make his way around the heartlands with a family that had saved him from dying in some back alley.<br />

Feat: Shield Master &#8211; You use shields not just for protection but also for offense. You gain the following benefits while you are wielding a shield:<br />
&#8211; If you take the Attack action on your turn, you can use a bonus action to try to shove a creature within 5 feet of you with your shield.<br />
&#8211; If you aren’t incapacitated, you can add your shield’s AC bonus to any Dexterity saving throw you make against a spell or other harmful effect that targets only you.<br />
&#8211; If you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you can use your reaction to take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, interposing your shield between yourself and the source of the effect.</p>
